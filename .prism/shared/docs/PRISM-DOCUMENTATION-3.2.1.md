## What's New in 3.2.1

### Brainstorm Visual Companion Hardening

- **MCP channel stabilization** — switched notification method from experimental `notifications/claude/channel` to standard `notifications/message/create`, aligning with the stable MCP spec
- **Error resilience** — HTTP server startup failures and notification errors now log-and-continue instead of crashing the MCP stdio transport. The brainstorm channel stays alive even if the HTTP listener can't bind its port
- **Frame template redesign** — rewritten `frame-template.html` with improved layout, drawer toggle with collapse/expand, and section collapse with `sessionStorage` persistence
- **Selection fix** — added missing `.opt` selector to single-select deselection logic in `helper.js`, fixing a bug where option-style elements wouldn't deselect when clicking a new option
- **Drawer controls** — new `setupDrawerControls()` in helper.js adds drawer toggle, decision/parked item expand/collapse, and section collapse with state persistence across page reloads

### Research & Documentation

- Added memory and context preservation research (`code-intel/2026-04-11-memory-and-context-research.md`)
- Added Griot ecosystem knowledge architecture mapping (`research/2026-04-11-griot-ecosystem-knowledge-architecture.md`)

## What's New in 3.2.0

### `prism-subagent` — Same-Session Subagent-Driven Plan Execution

A new top-level skill fills the medium-tier gap between `prism-implement` (single phase, no subagents) and `prism-spectrum` (10+ stories, autonomous overnight via bash loop). For 3–10 task plans where Spectrum is overkill but `prism-implement` is too thin, `/prism-subagent` dispatches a fresh implementer subagent per task with two-stage review (`spec-reviewer` then `quality-reviewer`), bounded retries, and compaction-survivable state.

**Execution-models table now reads:**

| Scope | Skill |
|---|---|
| Single phase / quick fix | `/prism-implement` |
| **3–10 tasks, mostly independent, stay in session** | **`/prism-subagent`** ← new |
| 10+ stories, autonomous overnight | `/prism-spectrum` |
| Parallel investigation of unrelated failures | `/prism-debug` |

**Core innovations beyond generic subagent-driven development:**

- **Domain-aware context priming** — R3F / Electron / fullstack / experimental sandbox primers paste matching guidance into every implementer dispatch. R3F implementers won't allocate inside `useFrame`. Electron implementers won't bypass `contextBridge`. Fullstack implementers won't update one side of a contract without the other.
- **Diff-only reviews** — reviewers receive `git diff` + spec excerpt, never full files. ~80% token reduction on the highest-volume operation in the loop.
- **5-status protocol** — adds `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` (asks the user) distinct from `NEEDS_CONTEXT` (controller resolves), preventing the controller from inventing product decisions under pressure.
- **Review decision matrix** — 9 task classes (`config`, `docs`, `revert`, `test-only`, `refactor`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `contract`, `experiment`) with explicit, inspectable skip rules. Config-only / docs-only skip both review stages; experiments get light review only; contract changes get extra blast-radius checks.
- **Repeated-issue detector** — every reviewer issue is normalized to a fingerprint (`kebab-case-summary:file-path`) and stored in `state.json.raised_issues`. If a reviewer raises an issue already in the set, the task halts immediately rather than entering another fix cycle. Kills the classic "implementer fixes A, breaks B, fixes B, breaks A" oscillation loop.
- **No-op spin detector** — if the implementer's diff is byte-identical to the previous cycle's diff, the controller halts immediately. Catches the failure mode where an implementer "fixes" by reverting prior work or commits empty changes.
- **Auto model escalation ladder** — per-task `model_ladder` (default `haiku → sonnet → opus`; `sonnet → opus → opus` for `feature`/`contract` classes; `haiku → haiku → sonnet` for `experiment` class). On `BLOCKED` the controller advances the ladder before retrying.
- **3-cycle hard caps** — `retry_count`, `review_cycles`, and `consecutive_escalations` all hard cap at 3. No "just one more try."
- **Reviewer isolation** — reviewers never see prior reviewers' complaints, preventing groupthink reinforcement.
- **Compaction-survivable `state.json`** — single source of truth at `.prism/local/subagent/<plan-slug>/state.json`. Recovery protocol checks git tree state vs declared task status. Controller never asks "what were we doing?" after a compact.
- **Tasks extracted ONCE** — plan is read at run start, tasks frozen into `state.json.tasks[*].spec_text`. No plan re-reads ever again.

**Skill structure (progressive disclosure per `cl-plugin-structure` guidelines):**

```
skills/prism-subagent/
├── SKILL.md                          ~700 tokens — entry point, decision flow, iron laws
└── references/                       on-demand, ~5500 tokens total

    └── domain-hints.md               R3F / Electron / fullstack / experimental primers
```

Reuses existing `agents/spec-reviewer.md` and `agents/quality-reviewer.md` verbatim (zero duplication with `prism-spectrum`).

### `prism-dispatch` — Generalized Parallel Fan-Out

Companion skill that codifies the parallel-agent dispatch pattern for ad-hoc use, sibling to `prism-research` (fixed agent roster) and `prism-debug` (fixed 3-agent flow). Use when facing 2+ independent problem domains that can be investigated or fixed concurrently without shared state.

**Key content:**
- When-to-use decision flow + sibling-skills disambiguation table
- 4-step pattern: identify domains → focused prompts → parallel dispatch (single message, multiple Task calls) → integrate
- Per-agent model selection guidance
- Anti-patterns: fan-out stampede (cap at 5 agents per dispatch), hidden sequential dependencies (file-overlap audit before dispatching)

### `scripts/extract-tasks.py` — Deterministic Plan-to-State Extractor

A ~280-line Python script that parses Prism plan markdown into a complete `state.json` skeleton. Replaces ~3000 tokens of LLM extraction per `prism-subagent` run with deterministic regex parsing.

**Features:**
- Regex-based task header / files / steps / acceptance parsing (matches Prism plan convention)
- Auto-classification into all 9 review classes per the review decision matrix
- Auto-detection of domain (`r3f` / `electron` / `fullstack` / `experiment` / `mixed`) via keyword scoring against plan content + file paths
- Per-task model ladder selection based on review class
- Atomic write (`.tmp` then rename) to prevent corruption mid-write
- `--stdout` mode for inspection without writing
- `--force` to overwrite, `--domain` to override auto-detection
- Exit code 3 → controller falls back to LLM extraction (plan format unfamiliar)

**Verified against 4 real Prism plans + 3 fixture plans — 100% extraction success, 0 warnings.**

### Compaction Hook Integration for `prism-subagent`

`scripts/pre-compact.py` extended with `get_active_subagent_run()` that scans `.prism/local/subagent/*/state.json` for in-flight runs. Picks the most recently updated state file with at least one non-complete task. Embeds the result into `compact-snapshot.json` as `active_subagent_run`.

`scripts/post-compact.py` extended to read `active_subagent_run` from the snapshot and surface a recovery message that names the state file path, current task, pending count, and explicit instructions to read the recovery protocol without re-extracting the plan.

**Result:** A `prism-subagent` run that gets compacted mid-execution recovers automatically via the existing PreCompact/PostCompact hooks — no manual state restoration required.

### Eval Suite for `prism-subagent` v3.2.0

New eval suite at `.prism/shared/evals/v3.2.0/skills/prism-subagent/`:

- **`evals.json`** — 8 eval cases across 6 dimensions: behavioral_compliance (extract-tasks pre-flight), loop_prevention (repeated-issue detector + no-op spin detector), token_optimization (diff-only review verification), domain_awareness (R3F primer injection), review_decision_matrix (contract class blast-radius), compaction_survival (state.json recovery), regression (iron laws presence check)
- **`fixtures/plan-simple.md`** — 3-task baseline (utility module + tests, mixed feature/test-only classes)
- **`fixtures/plan-contract.md`** — 3-task fullstack contract change (tests blast-radius detection)
- **`fixtures/plan-r3f.md`** — 3-task R3F component (tests domain auto-detection)
- **`baseline.json`** — captured baseline metrics + regression thresholds for future comparison

**Captured baseline:** all 9 fixture tasks extracted with 0 warnings; domain detection 2× fullstack + 1× r3f (correct); review classes feature/test-only/contract all classified per matrix rules; SKILL.md ~700 tokens (target <800); references total ~5500 tokens (loaded on demand).

## What's New in 3.1.1

### Packaging Fix — `.mcp.json` No Longer Shipped

Fixed an issue where the plugin's development-only `.mcp.json` (declaring `codebase-memory-mcp` + `chrome-devtools` for local dev) was being bundled into the release snapshot at `.claude/plugins/cache/prism-marketplace/prism/<version>/.mcp.json`. When users opened the prism-plugin repo as their working project, Claude Code saw duplicate MCP server registrations and emitted "MCP server skipped — already-configured" warnings in the plugin management UI.

**Fix**: `.mcp.json` is now gitignored. It stays on disk for local development but is no longer tracked in git or included in release snapshots. Users will no longer see the dedup warning when loading the plugin.

**Note**: This is a packaging-only patch. The plugin content (skills, agents, commands, hooks, scripts) is byte-identical to v3.1.0. The CLI binaries, VSIX extension, Electron installer, and Tauri installer from v3.1.0 remain valid — no rebuilds needed.

## What's New in 3.1.0

### Brainstorm Visual Companion — Major Upgrade

**Wake-on-click MCP channel** — Browser clicks on mockup options now wake Claude mid-session via a persistent `claude/channel` MCP server. No more copy/paste from browser to chat. The `brainstorm-channel` server is registered in `plugin.json` and spawns at plugin-load time. Session routing uses `session_id` in notification meta for multi-session disambiguation.

**Griotwave theming + Fidelity Engine** — The visual companion now ships with Prism's signature **neural-blue** ember from the griotwave design token library. Every rendered screen has a fidelity level (`lo`/`mid`/`hi`) controlled via `data-fidelity` attribute:

| Level | Look | When |
|---|---|---|
| `lo` | Wireframe energy — dashed borders, desaturated, no glass | Early exploration |
| `mid` | Structured — solid borders, light blur | Direction forming |
| `hi` | Full griotwave glass — backdrop blur, ember bloom | Confirmed picks, ceremonial final |

A classifier (`decide`/`clarify`/`park`) determines how user messages advance fidelity. Slash commands (`/lo` `/mid` `/hi`) provide explicit override. Carry-forward persists level across questions. Final-hi ceremonial rule ensures the last decision-confirm screen is always polished.

**Two-pane drawer** — Live-updating right-side sidebar rendering from `state/decisions.json`:
- **Decisions pane** (60%) — locked picks with back-pointers to question IDs
- **Parking lot pane** (40%) — deferred concerns with revisit notes
- Health signal: yellow warning at 5+ parked items ("session may be over-scoped")
- Live WebSocket updates via `fs.watch` on `decisions.json`

**Extension integration** — New `brainstormViewerWatcher.ts` in the VS Code extension watches `.prism/local/brainstorm/*/state/open-viewer` and auto-opens the Simple Browser when the companion server starts.

### Corrected Skill Graph — brainstorm → design

Fixed the inverted skill graph where `prism-design` called `prism-brainstorm` as a sub-step. The corrected flow:

```
prism-brainstorm  →  .prism/shared/brainstorms/<date>-<topic>.md  (decision ledger)
        ↓
prism-design      →  .prism/shared/designs/<date>-<topic>-design.md  (markdown sidecar)
                  →  .prism/shared/designs/<date>-<topic>.pen       (pencil layout)
        ↓
prism-plan → prism-implement → prism-validate
```

- `prism-brainstorm` now produces a **decision ledger** (not an architectural design doc) with locked decisions, deferred concerns, reference artifacts, and handoff notes
- `prism-design` now reads the ledger as **required upstream input** (`require_brainstorm: true` default; exploratory mode available via `require_brainstorm: false`)
- Design output is **dual**: markdown sidecar (read by `/prism-plan`) + `.pen` file (pencil MCP integration via `batch_design`)

### New Skills

- **`/prism-bookend`** — Context-aware release workflow. Analyzes commits since last version, suggests semantic version increment, creates documentation snapshot, syncs VitePress site, and triggers GitHub release. Accepts explicit version override or auto-suggests based on commit type analysis (feat → minor, fix → patch).

### New Directory

- **`.prism/shared/brainstorms/`** — Decision ledgers from `/prism-brainstorm`. Added to `init_prism.py`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `prism-init` skill.

### Token Optimization

- **Progressive disclosure for `prism-brainstorm`** — Extracted Fidelity Engine (519 words) and Drawer State (261 words) into `references/` files. Core SKILL.md trimmed from ~1800 → ~1000 tokens (44% reduction). Reference files loaded on-demand only when rendering screens or writing state.

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows cp1252 encoding crash in `init_prism.py`** — Fixed pre-existing bug where `path.write_text()` defaulted to cp1252 on Windows Python 3.14. All I/O calls now use `encoding="utf-8"`.
- **CLAUDE.md drift** — Added missing `contracts/` entry to `.prism/` directory tree.

## Overview

Prism ships as three complementary interfaces for the same 4-phase workflow (Research → Plan → Implement → Validate):

| Interface | Location | Tech Stack | Best For |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| **CLI Dashboard** | `apps/prism-cli/` | Go 1.23, Bubble Tea, FauxGL | Terminal-native, full-screen TUI, Spectrum execution |
| **VS Code Extension** | `apps/prism-vscode/` | TypeScript, React 18, Vite | IDE-integrated, chat-driven, visual office & monitor |
| **Electron Desktop App** | `apps/prism-electron/` | TypeScript, React 19, Electron 40, Vite, Tailwind v4 | Standalone desktop app, V2 IDE shell, native menus |
| **Eval Dashboard** | `prism-eval/` | Electron 40, React 19, Tailwind v4, Recharts, Dagre | Skill evaluation viewer — benchmarks, traces, graphs |

All four share the same `.prism/` directory structure, `stories.json` schema, signal protocol, and Claude CLI integration. They can be used independently or side-by-side. The Electron app features a full V2 IDE shell with activity bars, collapsible rails, tabbed editors, and floating chat pill. It shares all business logic, React UI components, and the gRPC-over-postMessage protocol with the VS Code extension via a proper npm monorepo with `packages/prism-core` and `packages/prism-ui` shared packages (see Part V — Monorepo Architecture). A unified Tauri-based installer (`apps/prism-installer/`) provides native Windows `.exe` and macOS `.dmg` installers with platform-specific wizard UIs. A VitePress documentation site at `prism-docs/` provides navigable, searchable documentation across ~79 pages (see Part VI). A dedicated Eval Dashboard at `prism-eval/` visualizes skill evaluation results, benchmarks, and agent traces (see Part VII).

# Part I — Claude Plugin Architecture (Prompt Engineering)

The Prism Claude Code plugin is the foundation that underpins every platform — the CLI dashboard, VS Code extension, and Electron app all exist to visualize and control workflows that the plugin defines. The plugin itself is **pure markdown-based prompt engineering** with zero build step. It extends Claude Code with structured workflows, specialized agents, and orchestration skills that transform raw AI capability into a disciplined development methodology.

## Plugin Overview

The Prism plugin registers with Claude Code through a conventional directory layout that is automatically discovered at startup. It provides:

- **25 commands** — User-invocable operations via `/command-name` (4,023 lines)
- **11 agents** — Specialized subprocesses spawned via `Task(subagent_type="agent-name")` (1,491 lines)
- **14 skills** — Auto-activating workflow orchestrators with trigger patterns (2,496 lines)
- **5 scripts** — Shell, PowerShell, and Python automation (921 lines)
- **No hooks or MCP servers** — The plugin relies entirely on prompt engineering, not runtime hooks

### What Makes It Different

Unlike traditional software plugins that extend functionality through code, Prism extends Claude Code's behavior through carefully structured natural language instructions. Each `.md` file is a prompt that shapes how Claude approaches a task — what agents to spawn, what questions to ask, what output format to use, and what behavioral constraints to follow. The prompt engineering is the product.

## Three-Layer Architecture

The plugin follows a strict three-layer architecture where each layer has a distinct responsibility:

**Key principle**: Skills orchestrate, commands operate, agents specialize. A skill never does the work itself — it delegates to commands and agents. Commands may also spawn agents for parallel research.

---

## Commands Reference

Commands live at `commands/` and are user-invocable via `/command-name`. Each is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter specifying `description` and `model`.

## Agents Reference

Agents live at `agents/` and are spawned via `Task(subagent_type="agent-name")`. They run as parallel subprocesses, each with a designated model and restricted tool set.

### Research Agents

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | `codebase-locator` | `codebase-locator.md` | 122 | **haiku** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Find WHERE code lives — file locations by feature. Does NOT analyze contents. |
| 2 | `codebase-analyzer` | `codebase-analyzer.md` | 143 | **opus** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Understand HOW code works — traces data flow, explains logic with file:line refs. |
| 3 | `codebase-pattern-finder` | `codebase-pattern-finder.md` | 227 | **sonnet** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Finds similar implementations, returns concrete code examples to model after. |
| 4 | `prism-locator` | `prism-locator.md` | 134 | **haiku** | Read, Glob, Grep | Discovers documents in `.prism/` directory, categorizes by type. |
| 5 | `prism-analyzer` | `prism-analyzer.md` | 175 | **opus** | Read, Glob, Grep | Deep-dives on `.prism/` documents, extracts decisions and actionable items. "Documentarian, Not Critic" principle enforced. |
| 6 | `web-search-researcher` | `web-search-researcher.md` | 108 | **sonnet** | WebSearch, WebFetch, Read | Researches current information from the web with source links. |

### Debug Agents

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 7 | `log-investigator` | `log-investigator.md` | 106 | **haiku** | Bash | Analyzes log files for errors, warnings, and patterns. |
| 8 | `state-investigator` | `state-investigator.md` | 121 | **haiku** | Bash | Examines application state: databases, config files, environment. |
| 9 | `git-investigator` | `git-investigator.md` | 140 | **haiku** | Bash | Analyzes git history to find changes related to a reported issue. |

### Verification Agent

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 10 | `browser-verifier` | `browser-verifier.md` | 92 | **haiku** | Bash | Executes playwright-cli commands, returns structured JSON verification results. |

### Code Intelligence Agent (v2.5.0)

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 11 | `graph-navigator` | `graph-navigator.md` | 95 | **haiku** | codebase-memory-mcp (11 graph tools) | Queries the codebase knowledge graph for structural analysis — functions, call chains, dependencies, dead code, blast radius. Never reads files directly; uses graph tools exclusively. |

### Visual Regression Agent

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 12 | `visual-regression-grader` | `visual-regression-grader.md` | ~100 | **sonnet** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Grades visual regression diffs: regression, intentional, or inconclusive. |

### Review Agents (v3.0.1)

Two-stage review agents dispatched sequentially after Spectrum quality gates pass. Spec compliance is verified first, then code quality. Both are read-only — they cannot modify code.

| # | Agent | File | Lines | Model | Tools | Role |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 13 | `spec-reviewer` | `spec-reviewer.md` | ~70 | **sonnet** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Verifies implementation matches story requirements exactly. Checks for missing requirements, over-building, and scope drift. **Does NOT trust implementer self-reports** — verifies independently. |
| 14 | `quality-reviewer` | `quality-reviewer.md` | ~75 | **sonnet** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Reviews code quality, architecture, and testing AFTER spec compliance passes. Checks file responsibility, decomposition, testing, production readiness. |

### Agent Frontmatter Format

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Description shown in Claude Code's agent registry
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash
model: opus|sonnet|haiku
---

You are a specialist at [specific capability]. Your job is to [specific task]...
```

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Single responsibility** — Each agent does one thing well (locate, analyze, find patterns, etc.)
2. **Restricted tools** — Agents only receive the tools they need; `codebase-locator` gets Glob/Grep but NOT Edit
3. **Model-appropriate** — Fast lookup tasks use Haiku, deep analysis uses Opus, general work uses Sonnet
4. **Parallel by default** — Skills spawn 3–6 agents concurrently; agents never depend on each other's output

---

## Skills Reference

Skills live at `skills/*/SKILL.md` and are auto-discovered workflow orchestrators. They activate automatically based on trigger patterns in user messages or are invoked explicitly via `/skill-name`.

### Core Workflow Skills

| # | Skill | Lines | Model | Trigger Patterns |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | `prism` | 276 | **sonnet** | "help me build", "implement this feature", "fix this bug", "prism", "structured workflow" |
| 2 | `prism-research` | 121 | **sonnet** | "research this", "understand how X works", "map out the system", "explore the codebase" |
| 3 | `prism-plan` | 126 | **opus** | "create a plan", "plan the implementation", "design how to build" |
| 4 | `prism-implement` | 122 | **sonnet** | "implement the plan", "start building", "execute phase 1" |
| 5 | `prism-validate` | 108 | **sonnet** | "validate the plan", "verify implementation", "check if complete" |
| 6 | `prism-iterate` | 103 | **opus** | "iterate on plan", "update and continue", "adjust the approach" |

### Specialized Skills

| # | Skill | Lines | Model | Trigger Patterns |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 7 | `prism-debug` | 221 | **sonnet** | "debug this", "why is this failing", "investigate the error" |
| 8 | `prism-spectrum` | 254 | **sonnet** | "spectrum", "execute story", "run spectrum" |
| 9 | `prism-verify` | 125 | **sonnet** | "verify the UI", "check the browser", "visual verification" |
| 10 | `prism-prd` | 122 | **opus** | "create a PRD", "write product requirements", "document this product" |
| 11 | `prism-visual-docs` | 146 | **opus** | "create user flows", "design the screens", "create wireframes" |

### Design & Completion Skills (v3.0.1)

| # | Skill | Lines | Model | Trigger Patterns |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 12 | `prism-brainstorm` | ~90 | **opus** | "brainstorm this", "design options", "explore approaches", "let's think about" |
| 13 | `prism-design` | ~80 | **opus** | "design this", "create a design", "design the architecture" |
| 14 | `prism-finish` | ~100 | **sonnet** | "finish this branch", "ready to merge", "create PR", "clean up branch" |

**`prism-brainstorm`** includes a browser-based **Visual Companion** — a zero-dependency Node.js HTTP/WebSocket server that serves interactive HTML mockups for A/B design choices. User clicks are captured as JSONL events. The server runs on an ephemeral port, auto-detects Windows/macOS/Linux, and supports dark/light themes.

**`prism-design`** bridges research and planning — it produces architectural decisions, interface contracts, and visual documentation that the planning phase turns into tasks.

**`prism-finish`** presents 4 structured options: merge locally, push and create PR (via `/describe_pr`), keep as-is, or discard (requires confirmation). Handles worktree cleanup.

### Setup & Utility Skills (v3.0.3)

| # | Skill | Lines | Model | Trigger Patterns |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 15 | `prism-init` | 53 | **haiku** | "init prism", "set up prism", "initialize prism", "create .prism folder" |

**`prism-init`** wraps `init_prism.py` to initialize the `.prism/` directory structure in any project. Creates 15 directories including `designs/` (Figma/Pencil.dev files) and `assets/` (AI-generated images, videos, 3D models), updates `.gitignore`, and optionally adds a Prism section to `CLAUDE.md`.

### Release, Eval & Docs Skills (v2.5.0)

| # | Skill | Lines | Model | Trigger Patterns |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 16 | `prism-release` | 245 | — | "release", "bump version", "new version", "cut a release" |
| 17 | `prism-eval` | 237 | **sonnet** | "run evals", "compare versions", "benchmark skills", "evaluate v2.5.0", "regression check" |
| 18 | `prism-docs-update` | 138 | — | "update prism docs", "sync docs site", "update documentation site" |

Orchestration instructions: which agents to spawn, which commands to invoke,
what order to execute, how to present results to the user...
```

### Master Orchestrator: `prism`

The `prism` skill (275 lines) is the master orchestrator — it routes to all other skills:

```
User: "help me build a login form"
    │
    ▼
prism skill activates (trigger: "help me build")
    │
    ├── Detects task type → routes to appropriate phase
    │
    ├── If unfamiliar codebase → /prism-research
    ├── If needs design work   → /prism-brainstorm → /prism-design (v3.0.1)
    ├── If needs planning      → /prism-plan
    ├── If plan exists         → /prism-implement
    ├── If needs validation    → /prism-validate
    ├── If needs iteration     → /prism-iterate
    └── If work is complete    → /prism-finish (v3.0.1)
```

## Scripts & Automation

### `scripts/spectrum.sh` (518 lines)

The Spectrum iterative executor — the main autonomous execution loop that spawns fresh Claude Code sessions per story. In v2.5.1, all deterministic operations (story selection, status updates, schema validation, progress logging, lockfile management) were moved from the AI skill into this bash script for reliability.

### Other Scripts

| Script | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `scripts/visual-regression.sh` | Bash | Captures screenshots via playwright-cli, diffs against baselines with pixelmatch, outputs structured JSON |
| `scripts/bump-version.py` | Python | Reads VERSION, bumps semver, updates all JSON/source files containing the version string |

---

## Hooks Reference (v3.0.1)

Prism uses 7 lifecycle hooks, all `command` type (zero LLM cost). Hooks are configured in `hooks/hooks.json`.

| Hook Event | Matcher | Script | Purpose |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|
| **PreCompact** | (all) | `pre-compact.py` | Save workflow state before context compression |
| **PostCompact** | (all) | `post-compact.py` | Restore state after context compression |
| **PostToolUse** | Write\|Edit\|Bash | `log-observation.py` | Track file modifications for session continuity |
| **WorktreeCreate** | (all) | `worktree-setup.sh` | Auto-setup dependencies, config, `.prism/` symlink |
| **WorktreeRemove** | (all) | `worktree-cleanup.sh` | Safety checks before worktree deletion |
| **SubagentStart** | (all) | `log-agent.py` | Log agent dispatch for cost tracking |
| **SubagentStop** | (all) | `log-agent.py` | Log agent completion with duration and tokens |

All hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for portable paths. Python scripts use `pathlib` for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Haiku — Fast Lookups & Simple Operations

Used for tasks that are fast, focused, and don't require nuanced judgment.

| Component | Type | Why Haiku |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| `codebase-locator` | Agent | File location via Glob/Grep — no analysis needed |
| `prism-locator` | Agent | Directory scanning — mechanical task |
| `log-investigator` | Agent | Log file parsing — pattern matching |
| `state-investigator` | Agent | Environment checks — straightforward |
| `git-investigator` | Agent | Git log analysis — structured data |

### Session Handoffs

When context window limits are reached:

```
/create_handoff  → .prism/shared/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md
                          │
                    (new Claude session)
                          │
/resume_handoff  ← reads handoff + validates current state → continues work
```

---

## Behavioral Principles

The plugin enforces several key behavioral constraints through its prompt engineering:

### 1. "Documentarian, Not Critic"

All research agents are instructed to **only describe what exists**. They do NOT:
- Suggest improvements
- Critique implementation choices
- Perform root cause analysis (unless explicitly asked)
- Recommend refactoring

This prevents research from becoming opinionated, ensuring clean separation between observation (research phase) and decision-making (plan phase).

### 2. Interactive Planning

Plans are contracts, not suggestions. The planning process:
1. Present understanding of the codebase first
2. Get user buy-in before proceeding
3. Iterate on each section with feedback
4. Never write a full plan in one shot
5. Resolve all unknowns before finalizing
6. Always separate "Automated Verification" (runnable commands) from "Manual Verification" (human testing)

### 3. Fresh Context Per Iteration

Spectrum gives each story a fresh Claude session via `spectrum.sh`. Memory persists through:
- `stories.json` (status, steps, commit hashes)
- `progress.md` (accumulated learnings)
- Git commits (the actual work)

This prevents context window degradation across long-running autonomous execution.

### 4. Two-Category Success Criteria

Every plan separates verification into:

| Category | Examples | Runner |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Automated Verification** | `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` | Claude / Spectrum |
| **Manual Verification** | "Click the login button and verify redirect" | Human tester |

### 5. Signal Protocol

Autonomous execution uses XML-like signals for flow control:

| Signal | Tag | Meaning |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Complete | `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | Story finished successfully |
| Continue | `<spectrum-continue>` | Success, schedule next iteration |
| Continue w/ Concerns | `<spectrum-continue><concerns>...</concerns>` | Success, but flagged doubts (v3.0.1) |
| Needs Context | `<spectrum-needs-context>` | Missing information, skip to next story (v3.0.1) |
| Retry | `<spectrum-retry reason="...">` | Transient failure, retry |
| Blocked | `<spectrum-blocked reason="...">` | Cannot proceed, skip |
| Error | `<spectrum-error reason="...">` | Fatal error, stop |

### 6. Two-Stage Review (v3.0.1)

After Spectrum quality gates pass, two reviewer agents are dispatched sequentially:

1. **Spec Compliance** (`spec-reviewer` agent) — verifies implementation matches requirements exactly. Checks for missing requirements, over-building, and scope drift. **Does not trust implementer self-reports.**
2. **Code Quality** (`quality-reviewer` agent) — reviews code quality, architecture, and testing. Only dispatched after spec compliance passes.

Review is skipped only for config-only changes, documentation-only stories, or reverts.

### 7. Implementer Status Protocol (v3.0.1)

During Spectrum execution, stories report one of four statuses:

| Status | Meaning | What Happens |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **DONE** | Confident in quality | Proceed to quality gates → review |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Complete but with doubts | Log concerns, proceed to gates (review catches issues) |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Missing information | Emit signal, skip to next story |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot complete | Emit signal with root cause |

### 8. Independent Verification / Distrust Pattern (v3.0.1)

The `prism-validate` skill independently verifies all claimed completions. It does NOT trust checkbox status in plans — it reads actual code, greps for implementing functions, and checks `git diff --stat` for unplanned changes. Output is a requirement-by-requirement verification table.

All read/write .prism/ — All parse signal protocol — All spawn claude CLI
```

The plugin's markdown files are loaded by the `claude` CLI process at session start. Every platform spawns `claude` as a child process, and the plugin's skills, commands, and agents shape how that `claude` session behaves. The platforms only provide visualization, user interaction, and process management — the actual workflow intelligence lives in the plugin's prompt engineering.

**MCP Servers (v3.0.2):** The plugin includes `codebase-memory-mcp` for structural code analysis and `chrome-devtools` (Chrome DevTools MCP, `--slim --headless --isolated`) for browser debugging escalation.

**Channels (v3.1.0):** The plugin registers `brainstorm-channel` as a stdio MCP server declaring the `claude/channel` capability. It spawns at plugin-load time and provides the wake-on-click bridge for the brainstorm visual companion — browser POSTs to the channel's HTTP endpoint trigger `notifications/claude/channel` events that wake Claude mid-session without requiring user copy/paste.

# Part II — CLI Dashboard

Prism CLI is a Go 1.23 terminal user interface that provides real-time monitoring and control of the Spectrum autonomous development workflow. It spawns Claude Code CLI sessions to execute stories from a `stories.json` file, displays streaming tool activity, tracks progress with spring-animated UI elements, and renders a procedural 3D splash screen using software rasterization.

### Key Features (CLI)

- **13 views**: Splash, Onboarding, Home menu, Research browser, Plans browser, Spectrum execution dashboard, Files browser, Git integration, Agent chat, Monitor dashboard, Browser verification, Workspaces manager
- **Plugin architecture**: 11 composable plugins with shared context, event bus, epoch-based staleness, and lifecycle management
- **Real-time execution monitoring**: Streaming Claude CLI output with tool activity extraction
- **Procedural splash screen**: Icosahedron mesh, beam particles, spectral wave field, and ANSI true-color rendering
- **3D animated prism logo**: FauxGL software rasterizer with half-block Unicode encoding
- **Spring physics animations**: Harmonica-driven progress bars, story pop effects, log slide-ins
- **Signal-based workflow control**: XML protocol for Continue, Retry, Blocked, Error, Complete
- **Multi-epic support**: Tab-based epic switching with independent story sets
- **App shell**: Powerline tab bar, context-aware sidebar, two-tier status footer
- **Terminal detection**: Auto-detects IDE (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), theme colors, Nerd Font support
- **Diff rendering**: Unified and side-by-side views with syntax highlighting and word-level diffs
- **Modal & dialog system**: Layered overlays with focus cycling, permission prompts, command palette
- **File watcher**: fsnotify-based real-time file change detection with debouncing and EventBus integration
- **Persisted UI state**: Per-project state persistence (open tabs, expanded dirs, diff mode) across sessions
- **Fuzzy file finder**: Project-wide fuzzy file search overlay with scoring algorithm
- **Content search**: Ripgrep-powered project-wide content search with result navigation
- **Conversation browser**: Multi-adapter session scanning (Claude Code `.jsonl` files)
- **Interactive agent chat**: Live Claude CLI streaming with thinking blocks, tool spinners, and structured content parts
- **Thinking block visualization**: Extended thinking rendered as dim italic `💭` text in real-time
- **Tool activity spinners**: Animated braille spinners (80ms tick) for running tools with status indicators
- **Enhanced status bar**: Phase name, active tool, elapsed time, and signal display during streaming
- **Uninstaller**: `--uninstall` flag for clean removal of binary, PATH entries, and global config
- **Demo mode**: 36 pre-seeded stories with auto-progression for previewing animations

### Elm Architecture Pattern

The application follows the Elm Architecture (Model-Update-View), extended with a plugin system:

```

## Getting Started

### Build

```bash
cd apps/prism-cli

make build          # Build for current platform → bin/prism-cli
make build-all      # Cross-compile (windows/darwin/linux × amd64/arm64)
make test           # Run tests: go test -v ./...
make lint           # Run golangci-lint
make install        # Install to GOPATH/bin
make run ARGS=..    # Development run
make clean          # Remove bin/ and go clean
make help           # Display help text
```

### Run

```bash
# Direct with stories file
prism-cli .prism/stories/stories.json

# Auto-discover .prism/ in current directory
prism-cli

# Demo mode (no stories.json needed)
prism-cli --demo

# Force onboarding flow (testing)
prism-cli --onboarding

# With options
prism-cli -f stories.json -n 100 -p 5 --prism-style braille
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--file` | `-f` | `""` | Path to stories.json |
| `--max-iterations` | `-n` | `50` | Maximum iterations before stopping |
| `--pause` | `-p` | `2` | Seconds between iterations |
| `--demo` | | `false` | Run with simulated stories |
| `--onboarding` | | `false` | Force onboarding flow (for testing/refining the setup wizard) |
| `--prism-style` | | `gradient` | Animation style: `gradient` `simple` `braille` `ascii` |
| `--uninstall` | | `false` | Remove prism-cli binary, PATH entries, and global `~/.prism/` directory |

Auto-generated: `--version`, `--help`/`-h`

#### Uninstall System

The `--uninstall` flag provides clean removal:
1. Prompts for `yes` confirmation via stdin
2. Removes binary from `~/.prism/bin/` (both `prism-cli` and `prism-cli.exe`)
3. Cleans shell profiles (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`) — removes lines containing `.prism/bin` or `# Prism CLI`
4. On Windows: cleans PowerShell profile (auto-detects `pwsh.exe` or `powershell.exe`)
5. Removes entire `~/.prism/` directory (global config, not per-project)
6. Does NOT touch per-project `.prism/` directories

### Initial View Selection

```
--demo flag set           → ViewSplash → Home (demo mode)
stories.json provided     → ViewSplash → Home or Onboarding
No stories.json, .prism/  → ViewSplash → Onboarding (if needed) → Home
No .prism/ directory      → ViewSplash → Onboarding (auto-set)
Legacy thoughts/ dir      → ViewSplash → Onboarding (legacy migration)
```

The splash screen always displays first (5-second timer or any keypress to skip). After splash, the app transitions to Onboarding if `.prism/` doesn't exist or `stories.json` is missing, otherwise to Home. Legacy `thoughts/` directories trigger the onboarding migration flow.

After TUI exits, the project is auto-registered in the global workspace registry (`~/.prism/workspaces.json`) via `registry.Register()`. The terminal G0 charset is also reset (`\x1b(B\x1b[0m`) to prevent DEC Special Graphics mode from persisting into the parent shell.

---

## Plugin System

### Plugin Interface

Every screen in the TUI is implemented as a plugin conforming to `plugin.Plugin` (11 methods):

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `ID()` | `string` | Unique identifier (e.g. `"home"`, `"spectrum"`) |
| `Name()` | `string` | Human-readable name for tab display |
| `Icon()` | `string` | Emoji/symbol for tab bar |
| `Init(ctx *Context)` | `error` | Initialization with shared context |
| `Start()` | `tea.Cmd` | Called when first activated |
| `Stop()` | `void` | Called on deactivation |
| `Update(msg tea.Msg)` | `(Plugin, tea.Cmd)` | Bubble Tea message handler |
| `View(width, height int)` | `string` | Render content for given dimensions |
| `IsFocused()` | `bool` | Whether this plugin is the active view |
| `SetFocused(bool)` | `void` | Sets focus state |
| `KeyHints()` | `[]KeyHint` | Footer key-hint list |

### Plugin Context

Shared state passed to all plugins during `Init()`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `PrismDir` | `string` | Path to `.prism/` directory |
| `ProjectDir` | `string` | Project root directory |
| `StoriesPath` | `string` | Path to active `stories.json` |
| `Width` | `int` | Terminal width |
| `Height` | `int` | Terminal height |
| `DemoMode` | `bool` | Whether running in demo mode |
| `PrismStyle` | `string` | Prism rendering style |
| `MaxIterations` | `int` | Max Spectrum iterations |
| `Pause` | `int` | Seconds between iterations |
| `HasNerdFont` | `bool` | Terminal supports Nerd Font glyphs |
| `EventBus` | `*EventBus` | Inter-plugin pub/sub communication |
| `WorkDir` | `string` | Working directory at startup |
| `GitRoot` | `string` | Git repository root directory |
| `ConfigDir` | `string` | User config directory (`~/.config/prism-cli`) |
| `Epoch` | `uint64` | Monotonic counter incremented on project switch (for staleness detection) |
| `HasLegacyDir` | `bool` | Whether a legacy `thoughts/` directory was detected |
| `LegacyDir` | `string` | Path to legacy `thoughts/` directory (for migration) |

### Epoch-Based Staleness

`Context.Epoch` is a critical architectural pattern. When the user switches projects (via Workspaces), `Registry.Reinit()` increments the epoch. All async `tea.Cmd` results carry the epoch at which they were dispatched. Handlers compare the message epoch against the current `Context.Epoch` — if they differ, the result is from a previous project and is silently discarded. This prevents stale file lists, story data, or Claude output from a previous project from corrupting the current view.

Example: User is viewing Project A's files. An async `ListFilesCmd` was dispatched at epoch 5. Before it returns, the user switches to Project B (epoch becomes 6). When the file list result arrives with epoch 5, the handler sees `5 != 6` and discards it, preventing Project A's files from appearing in Project B's view.

### Plugin Registry

The registry manages plugin lifecycle:

1. **Registration** (`Register`): Validates ID uniqueness, calls `Init(ctx)` with panic recovery, first plugin is auto-activated
2. **Activation** (`SetActive`): Unfocuses previous, focuses new plugin
3. **Broadcast** (`Broadcast`): Routes messages to ALL plugins, collects commands
4. **Reinit** (`Reinit`): Increments `Context.Epoch`, stops all plugins, re-initializes with current context (used on project switch)

### Event Bus

Thread-safe pub/sub communication (`sync.RWMutex`) with these event types:

| Event | Type String | Fields |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `StoryCompletedEvent` | `"story.completed"` | StoryID, StoryTitle |
| `FileChangedEvent` | `"file.changed"` | FilePath, Action |
| `BranchChangedEvent` | `"branch.changed"` | Branch |
| `EpicSwitchedEvent` | `"epic.switched"` | EpicName, StoriesPath |
| `ProjectSwitchedEvent` | `"project.switched"` | ProjectDir, PrismDir, StoriesPath |
| `AgentStatusEvent` | `"agent.status"` | AgentID, Status, Model, Activity |
| `ConversationChangedEvent` | `"conversation.changed"` | FilePath, Action |
| `QualityGateResultEvent` | `"gate.result"` | Gate, Passed, Output |
| `WorktreeChangedEvent` | `"worktree.changed"` | Action, Path |
| `BrowserVerificationEvent` | `"browser.verification"` | URL, Status, ScreenshotPath, ConsoleErrors |
| `BrowserSessionEvent` | `"browser.session"` | SessionID, Action, URL |

### Registered Plugins (in order)

| # | Plugin ID | Plugin Name | Source File | Lines |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `home` | Home | `plugin_home.go` | 214 |
| 2 | `research` | Research | `plugin_research.go` | 230 |
| 3 | `plans` | Plans | `plugin_plans.go` | 245 |
| 4 | `spectrum` | Spectrum | `plugin_spectrum.go` | 1,218 |
| 5 | `files` | Files | `plugin_files.go` | 1,407 |
| 6 | `git` | Git | `plugin_git.go` | 1,530 |
| 7 | `agent` | Agent | `plugin_agent.go` | 1,051 |
| 8 | `monitor` | Monitor | `plugin_monitor.go` | 917 |
| 9 | `browser` | Browser | `plugin_browser.go` | 726 |
| 10 | `workspaces` | Workspaces | `plugin_workspaces.go` | 1,981 |
| 11 | `onboarding` | Onboarding | `plugin_onboarding.go` | 685 |

### Tab Order

The tab bar displays 10 tabs (excluding Splash and Onboarding):

```
[1] Home  [2] Research  [3] Plans  [4] Spectrum  [5] Files  [6] Git  [7] Agent  [8] Monitor  [9] Browser  [0] Workspaces
```

#### Rendering Pipeline

1. Project 444 mesh vertices through Y/X/Z rotation + perspective
2. Rasterize 360 triangles with barycentric interpolation + back-face culling
3. Build beam light grid from particles with Gaussian glow falloff
4. Compute title layout ("P R I S M", gradient bar, subtitle)
5. Per-cell: combine wave field, beam particles, mesh overlay, halo dimming
6. Stamp title text in near-white (232, 232, 240)
7. Stamp gradient bar using 4-stop spectrum gradient
8. Convert cell grid to ANSI true-color string

#### IDE Boost Mode

When running in an IDE terminal (`BoostColors=true`), color parameters are intensified for better visibility against IDE backgrounds.

### 2. Onboarding Screen

A full-screen setup wizard displayed after the splash when `.prism/` directory or `stories.json` is missing. Walks through 4 steps to initialize the project.

#### Four Steps

| Step | Title | Description | Auto-detect |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Project Directory | Detect or select project directory | Yes — `os.Getwd()` |
| 2 | .prism/ Directory | Check/create .prism/ directory structure | Yes — `os.Stat` |
| 3 | Claude CLI | Verify claude CLI is installed | Yes — `exec.LookPath` |
| 4 | Stories File | Verify/create stories.json | Yes — `os.Stat` |

#### UI Layout

```

Note: "Iteration limit reached" renders in amber (`#F59E0B`). Status bar shows `⏸ PAUSED` (MaxIterations uses same String() as Paused) in amber. Some stories remain pending.

#### Panel Breakdown

**Panel 1: Epic Selector** (conditional — only shown when multiple epics exist)

- Selected epic: `CurrentStyle` (bold purple)
- Unselected: `DimStyle` (gray)
- Format: ` name (completed/total) `
- Execution is sequential — one epic at a time. The epic selector switches which epic's stories are displayed and executed.

**Panel 2: Header**

- Left: `TitleStyle("PRISM TUI")`
- Right: Iteration counter + help hint in `DimStyle`

**Panel 3: Progress Bar**

- 3D prism (left) + ASCII logo (right) joined horizontally
- Progress bar: spectrum gradient `█` (filled) + `░` in `#374151` (empty)
- Bar width: `termWidth - 20` (min 20)
- Progress driven by spring-animated position (not raw percentage)

**Panel 4: Story List** (40% width)

Story icons with animated states:

| Status | Icon | Style | Animation |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|-
| Complete (settling) | `●` | Green | Scale < 0.7 during pop |
| Complete (overshoot) | `✔` | Green | Scale > 1.1 during pop |
| Complete (final) | `✓` | Green | Pop animation finished |
| Active (bright) | `▶` | Bold purple | Pulse brightness > 0.8 |
| Active (dim) | `▸` | Bold purple | Pulse brightness ≤ 0.8 |
| Blocked | `⊘` | Italic amber | Static |
| Pending | `○` | Gray | Static |

**Panel 5: Activity Panel** (60% width)

State-dependent content:

| State | Activity Panel Content |
|-------|----------------------|
| Idle | "Press Enter to start execution" (dim) |
| Running | Story info + spinner + tool activity + recent activities |
| Paused | Story info + "Paused" status |
| Complete | "All stories complete!" (green) |
| MaxIterations | "Iteration limit reached" (amber) |
| Error | "Error occurred" (red) + error message |

**Panel 6: Log Panel**

Log level formatting:

| Level | Badge | Style |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Info | `INFO ` | Blue `#3B82F6` |
| Success | `OK   ` | Green `#10B981` |
| Warning | `WARN ` | Amber `#F59E0B` |
| Error | `ERROR` | Bold red `#EF4444` |
| Claude Output | `     ` | Gray `#6B7280` |

Format: `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL MESSAGE` — New entries slide in from the right via spring animation.

**Panel 7: Status Bar**

Three columns: State icon + name | Elapsed time | Control hints

| State | Icon | Color |
|-------|------|-------|
| Running | `▸` | Green `#10B981` |
| Paused | `⏸` | Amber `#F59E0B` |
| Complete | `▸` | Green `#10B981` |
| MaxIterations | `⏸` | Amber `#F59E0B` |
| Error | `▸` | Red `#EF4444` |
| Idle | `▸` | Gray `#6B7280` |

#### Spectrum Key Bindings

| Key | Action | State Required |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| `a` | Stories previous page | Any |
| `s` | Stories next page | Any |
| `z` | Logs previous page | Any |
| `x` | Logs next page | Any |
| `Tab` | Next epic | Multi-epic only |
| `Shift+Tab` | Previous epic | Multi-epic only |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Start execution | Idle |
| `Space` | Pause execution | Running |
| `/` | Skip current story | Running |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Resume execution | Paused |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Quit | Complete / MaxIterations / Error |

### 7. Files Screen

A two-pane file tree browser with preview. Left pane shows an expandable directory tree with git status badges; right pane shows file content with line numbers, syntax highlighting, multi-tab support, inline editing, and git blame annotations.

#### Features

- **Syntax highlighting** (F-1): Chroma-based highlighting for 100+ languages
- **Git status badges** (F-2): Modified (M/yellow), Added (A/green), Deleted (D/red), Untracked (?/gray) indicators on tree items
- **Multi-tab support** (F-3): Open multiple files in tabs, switch with `h`/`l`, close with `x`, max 10 tabs
- **Fuzzy file finder** (F-4): `Ctrl+D` opens a project-wide fuzzy file search overlay. File cache built asynchronously via `git ls-files` (or `filepath.Walk` fallback). Scoring: +10 per character match, +5 consecutive bonus, +8 separator boundary, +6 camelCase boundary, +15 filename start, -2 per gap. Shorter paths preferred as tiebreaker
- **Content search** (F-5): `Ctrl+S` opens a ripgrep-powered project-wide content search (`rg --json --max-count 30`). Results show file:line:text with navigation. Displays install instructions if `rg` binary not found
- **Inline file editing** (F-6): `e` opens a full textarea editor, `Ctrl+S` saves, `Esc` cancels
- **Git blame view** (F-7): `b` toggles blame annotations (short hash, author, relative age) alongside code

### 9. Agent Screen

An interactive chat interface with conversation history browsing, real-time streaming, thinking block visualization, tool activity tracking, and text input. Uses the **adapter system** (`app/adapter/`) to scan AI agent conversation files from disk and spawns live Claude CLI sessions for interactive chat. Supports wide mode (sidebar + chat) and compact mode (chat only).

#### Adapter System

The Agent screen uses a pluggable `Adapter` interface to discover conversation sessions:

| Adapter | ID | Data Source | Format |
|---------|----|-------------|--------|
| `ClaudeAdapter` | `"claude"` | `~/.claude/projects/` | `.jsonl` per session |

Each adapter implements: `ID()`, `Name()`, `Available()`, `ScanSessions()`, `LoadMessages(path)`. Additional adapters (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.) can be added by implementing the `Adapter` interface. Currently only Claude Code sessions are discovered.

**Session** metadata includes: ID, Title (first user message excerpt), Path, ProjectPath, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, MessageCount, TokenCount, Model.

The sidebar groups sessions by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.). `ClaudeAdapter.decodeProjectPath()` converts Claude's directory encoding (`c--Users-digit-Developer-prism-plugin`) back to filesystem paths.

#### Structured Content Parts (v2.4.1)

Messages use a structured `ContentPart` system for rich rendering of tool calls, thinking blocks, and agent spawns:

```go
type ContentPart struct {
    Type     PartType   // PartText, PartToolCall, PartToolResult, PartThinking, PartAgent
    Text     string     // For text/thinking content
    ToolName, ToolInput, ToolOutput, ToolStatus, ToolID string  // For tools
    AgentID, AgentName, AgentType string                        // For agents
    AgentParts []ContentPart                                    // Nested agent content
}
```

**Message rendering** (`chat/renderer.go`) supports:
- **User messages**: `"> "` prompt prefix with blue styling
- **Assistant messages**: Left accent bar (`▎`) with dark background, Glamour markdown rendering + structured parts below
- **Tool messages**: Compact single-line with animated status: `⠋ ToolName` (running spinner) → `✓ ToolName` (complete) → `✗ ToolName` (error)
- **Thinking blocks**: Dim italic text with `💭` prefix, rendered as Claude reasons through problems
- **Agent spawns**: `▸ AgentDescription` with collapsible nested parts and indentation

The `RenderParts(parts []ContentPart, width int, collapsed bool) string` function renders structured parts with proper styling, called from `plugin_agent.go` when MarkdownMode is enabled.

#### Streaming & Activity Visualization (v2.4.1)

The Agent screen now supports real-time streaming with live visualization of Claude's internal activity:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Incremental streaming** | Text appears character-by-character via `--output-format stream-json` |
| **Thinking blocks** | Extended thinking content renders as dim italic `💭 text...` in real-time |
| **Tool spinners** | Running tools show animated braille spinner (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`) at 80ms tick rate |
| **Agent tracking** | Subagent spawns tracked via `AgentTracker` with status (running/complete/error) |
| **Signal detection** | Spectrum signals (`<spectrum-continue>`, `<spectrum-retry>`, etc.) displayed in separator bar |

**Enhanced Status Separator Bar** (displayed between messages during streaming):

```
Research | ⬤ streaming… · Read src/main.go | 1.2k in / 0.5k out | 5s | [signal]
─────────  ──────────────────────────────   ──────────────────   ──   ────────
 Phase       Active tool name                 Token counts       Time   Signal
```

**Streaming internals** (`plugin_agent.go`):
- `upsertStreamingMessage()` — creates or updates the last assistant message with accumulated stream text
- `appendPart()` — adds structured parts (tool calls, thinking, agents) to current message
- `updateToolPartStatus()` — finds tool parts by ID and updates status with render cache invalidation
- Streaming messages bypass the render cache to show real-time updates

## App Shell

For all non-splash, non-onboarding views, content is wrapped in an "app shell" consisting of a tab bar, optional sidebar, and two-tier footer.

### Tab Bar

Two rendering modes depending on terminal width:

**Powerline Tab Bar** (3 lines, when terminal is wide enough):

```
 ╲  Home      ╲  Research  ╲  Spectrum  ╲  Files    ╲ ╲╲╲╲
  ╲  Home      ╲  Research  ╲  Spectrum  ╲  Files    ╲╲╲╲
   ╲  Home      ╲  Research  ╲  Spectrum  ╲  Files    ╲╲╲
```

- Active tab: white text on `Primary` (#7C3AED) background
- Inactive tabs: dim text on `#2c2d3a` background
- Diagonal slant separators create a distinctive visual edge
- Mouse clickable via `bubblezone` (zone IDs: `tab-0` through `tab-8`)

**Compact Tab Bar** (1 line, narrow terminals):

```
 1:Home │ 2:Research │ 3:Plans │ 4:Spectrum │ 5:Files │ 6:Git
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Sidebar

Fixed width: **38 characters**. Auto-shown when terminal width >= **120** characters. Toggled with `Ctrl+D`.

```

**Sidebar sections:**

1. **Branded header**: 3-line gradient PRISM block logo
2. **Execution info**: State icon, iteration counter, story progress
3. **Modified Files**: From Git plugin (staged + modified files with diff stats)
4. **Quality Gates**: From Monitor plugin (pass/fail status icons)
5. **Epics**: From Spectrum plugin (active/inactive indicators with progress)

### Footer

Two-tier footer spanning full terminal width.

**Tier 1: Key Hints** (context-aware)

```
[1-9] switch tabs  [tab/shift+tab] cycle  [j/k] navigate  [ctrl+d] details  [?] help  [q] quit  ╲╲╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱╱
```

Key hints include view-specific hints from the active plugin's `KeyHints()` method. Right edge has decorative slash pattern matching sidebar width.

**Tier 2: Powerline Status Bar**

```
 IMPLEMENT ╲ ⚡ Spectrum ╲  main ╲ STORY-003 ╲                ╱ v2.4.9 ╱ 3✓ 0✗ ╱ 8/12 ╱ iter 3 ╱ 🕒 2m 15s
```

Left segments:
1. Workflow phase pill (Research=Blue, Plan=Teal, Implement=Green, Validate=Amber)
2. Active plugin icon + name
3. Git branch name (from Git plugin)
4. Current story ID (from Spectrum plugin, when width >= 100)

Right segments:
1. Version (`v2.4.9`)
2. Quality gate counts (pass/fail, when width >= 80)
3. Story progress (completed/total)
4. Iteration counter (when width >= 90)
5. Elapsed time (when Spectrum is running)

## Modal & Dialog Systems

### Modal System

Modals are centered overlays with dimmed background. The compositing pipeline works row-by-row: rows within the modal's Y range use `compositeRow()` to insert modal content into a dimmed background; rows above/below are fully dimmed.

**Section types available:**
- `TextSection` — Static text, word-wrapped
- `SpacerSection` — Blank line
- `ButtonsSection` — Row of buttons (Normal/Primary/Danger variants)
- `InputSection` — Single-line text input
- `TextareaSection` — Multi-line text input
- `ListSection` — Scrollable selection list
- `CheckboxSection` — Toggleable checkbox
- `WhenSection` — Conditional section

**Modal variants:** Default (purple border), Danger (red), Warning (amber), Info (blue)

**Focus cycling:** Tab/Shift+Tab cycles through focusable elements using modular arithmetic.

### Command Palette

Activated with `Ctrl+P` or `:`. Provides fuzzy search across all plugin commands.

```
╭────────────────────── Command Palette ──────────────────────╮

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Dialog System

Dialogs are layered above modals in z-order. Two dialog types:

**Confirmation Dialog:**
- Two buttons: Confirm + Cancel
- Quick keys: `y` for confirm, `n` for cancel
- Variant-colored border

**Permission Dialog:**
- Three buttons: Allow + Allow Session + Deny
- Scrollable preview area (max 8 lines)
- Quick keys: `a` for allow, `s` for allow session, `d`/`n` for deny

### State Descriptions

| State | String | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `StateIdle` | `"IDLE"` | Waiting for user to press Enter to start |
| `StateRunning` | `"RUNNING"` | Claude CLI active, processing stories |
| `StatePaused` | `"PAUSED"` | Execution paused, can resume with `p` |
| `StateComplete` | `"COMPLETE"` | All stories finished successfully |
| `StateMaxIterations` | `"PAUSED"` | Iteration limit reached (soft stop) |
| `StateError` | `"ERROR"` | Fatal error, cannot continue |

### Signal Protocol

Signals are XML-like tags emitted in Claude's output text, parsed via regex:

| Signal | Tag | Priority | Action |
|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| Complete | `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | 1 (highest) | If 0 remaining → Complete; if remaining > 0 → override & continue |
| Error | `<spectrum-error reason="...\">...</spectrum-error>` | 2 | Fatal → Error state |
| Retry | `<spectrum-retry reason="...\">...</spectrum-retry>` | 3 | Increment error counter; retry if under limit (3) |
| Blocked | `<spectrum-blocked reason="...\">...</spectrum-blocked>` | 4 | Log warning, skip to next unblocked story |
| Continue | `<spectrum-continue>...</spectrum-continue>` | 5 | Success, schedule next iteration after pause |
| NeedsContext | `<spectrum-needs-context>...</spectrum-needs-context>` | 5 | Story requires additional context before proceeding; prompts user |
| None | (no match) | 6 | Assume continue |

## Animation System

All animations are driven by a 100ms tick (`TickMsg`) and use Harmonica spring physics for organic motion.

### Spring Configuration

| Animation | Stiffness | Damping | FPS | Initial | Target | Character |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----|---------|--------|-----------|-
| Progress Bar | 6.0 | 0.7 | 60 | 0.0 | `ProgressPercent()` | Snappy, slight overshoot |
| Story Pop | 8.0 | 0.5 | 60 | 0.3 (start scale) | 1.0 (normal) | Very bouncy |
| Log Slide-In | 5.0 | 0.8 | 60 | 20.0 (x-offset) | 0.0 (settled) | Smooth, minimal overshoot |
| Ray Length | 4.0 | 0.3 | 60 | `{6,5,4,3}` | Random 4–8 | Bouncy, organic |

### Animation Update Loop (per 100ms tick)

```

            │   ├── StoryPopSpring.Update()       (per-story scale → 1.0)
            │   │       └── cleanup when |scale - 1.0| < 0.01
            │   ├── PulsePhase += 0.15            (sine wave, wraps at 2π)
            │   │       └── active story icon brightness
            │   ├── LogSlideSpring.Update()       (per-entry offset → 0.0)
            │   └── RaySpring.Update()            (per-ray length → target)
            └── All other plugins (no-op for most)
```

### Continuous Animations

| Animation | Increment/Tick | Full Cycle | Effect |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| Pulse | +0.15 rad | ~4.2 seconds | Active story icon brightness oscillation (0.2 → 1.0) |
| Shimmer | +0.08 rad | ~7.85 seconds | Prism body brightness modulation (0.85 → 1.0) |
| Prism Frame | +1 every 300ms | 1.2 seconds | 4-color spectrum rotation on text prism |
| 3D Rotation | 0.6 rad/sec Y-axis | ~10.5 seconds | Full rotation of 3D prism model |

### Text Prism Fallback Variants

When the 3D renderer is unavailable (`m.Prism == nil`), a text-based prism is used:

## Splash Screen Rendering Pipeline

The splash screen (`splash/splash.go`) is a fully procedural animation rendered to ANSI true-color.

### Components

| Component | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Icosahedron mesh | 444 verts, 360 faces, pos(0.36, 0.50), scale 0.11 | Rotating 3D wireframe mesh |
| Beam particles | 200 particles, 4 rays, width 0.015 | Horizontal light beam |
| Spectral wave field | freq 34.0/26.0, speed 1.0 | Background wave pattern |
| Title | "P R I S M" | Centered text in near-white |
| Gradient bar | 4-stop spectrum gradient | Horizontal bar below title |

### Spectral Gradient (used throughout)

```
#3B82F6 ───▶ #14B8A6 ───▶ #22C55E ───▶ #F59E0B
 Blue          Teal         Green        Amber
```

### ASCII Density Ramp

```
{ ' ', '.', ',', ':', '-', '=', '+', '*', '#', '%', '@' }
```

11 characters from empty to full density, used for wave field and mesh rendering.

### Rendering Phases

1. Rotate and project 444 mesh vertices (Y/X/Z rotation + perspective distance 3.5)
2. Rasterize 360 triangles with barycentric interpolation + back-face culling
3. Build beam light grid from particle positions with Gaussian glow
4. Compute layout for title, bar, and subtitle (centered)
5. Per-cell compositing: wave field + beam particles + mesh overlay + halo dimming
6. Stamp title (232, 232, 240 near-white)
7. Stamp gradient bar
8. Stamp subtitle with atmospheric offset
9. Convert to ANSI string (batch same-color runs, reset per line)

    }
  ]
}

> **Note**: `stories.json` is re-read from disk after each iteration via `ReloadStoriesCmd`. External edits are picked up on the next reload, but concurrent writes are not locked. The `commitHash` field is populated when `MarkStoryComplete()` receives a commit reference, but automated extraction from Claude output is not yet implemented.

        s.Status != "complete" &&
        !s.IsBlocked(stories)     // blockedBy story must be complete
    )
    sort(candidates, by: Priority ascending)  // lower number = higher priority
    return candidates[0]  // or nil if empty

**Streaming mode** (used during execution):

```bash
claude \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --print \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose \
  "Execute the next story from {storiesPath} using the /prism-spectrum workflow. \
   Progress file: {progressPath}"
```

**Non-streaming mode** (fallback):

```bash
claude \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --print \
  "Execute the next story from {storiesPath} using the /prism-spectrum workflow. \
   Progress file: {progressPath}"

```

### Event Types (v2.4.1)

The streaming pipeline produces typed events via `agentbus/events.go`:

| Event | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `EventTextDelta` | `stream_event` | Incremental text content from Claude |
| `EventThinkingDelta` | `"thinking"` content block | Extended thinking/reasoning content |
| `EventToolCallStart` | `tool_use` content block | Tool invocation begins (name, input) |
| `EventToolCallComplete` | `tool_result` | Tool execution finished (output, status) |
| `EventAgentSpawnStart` | `Task` tool use | Subagent spawned (ID, name, type) |
| `EventAgentSpawnFinish` | Agent task completion | Subagent finished (result, status) |
| `EventSignalDetected` | Signal parser | Spectrum signal found in output |

### ContentBlock Extensions (v2.4.1)

`claude/events.go` `ContentBlock` struct now includes:

```go
type ContentBlock struct {
    Type      string `json:"type"`       // "text", "tool_use", "tool_result", "thinking"
    Text      string `json:"text"`
    ID        string `json:"id"`
    Name      string `json:"name"`
    Input     any    `json:"input"`
    Content   string `json:"content"`
    Thinking  string `json:"thinking"`   // NEW: Extended thinking content
    Signature string `json:"signature"`  // NEW: Thinking signature/metadata
}
```

### Tool Activity Formatting

| Tool | Display Format | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|-
| Read | `Reading: .../shortened/path.ts` | `Reading: .../services/auth.ts` |
| Edit | `Editing: .../shortened/path.ts` | `Editing: .../components/Form.tsx` |
| Write | `Writing: .../shortened/path.ts` | `Writing: .../config/db.ts` |
| Bash | `Running: command` (50 char max) | `Running: npm run typecheck` |
| Glob | `Finding: pattern` | `Finding: **/*.test.ts` |
| Grep | `Searching: pattern` (40 char max) | `Searching: handleSubmit` |
| Task | `Agent: description` (50 char max) | `Agent: Analyzing codebase...` |
| WebFetch | `Fetching: URL` (50 char max) | `Fetching: https://docs.example.com` |
| WebSearch | `Web search...` | `Web search...` |
| TodoWrite | `Updating tasks...` | `Updating tasks...` |
| AskUserQuestion | `Asking question...` | `Asking question...` |

### Output Parser Event Detection

The `OutputParser` maintains a buffer of all output and fires events on:

| Event | Detection | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Story Announced | `<spectrum-story>ID: STORY-NNN` tag | `parser.go:52` |
| Phase Changed | Keywords: "research", "implementing", "quality gate", etc. | `parser.go:65` |
| Quality Gate Started | "Running quality gates", "npm run typecheck/lint/test" | `parser.go:75` |
| Commit Created | "git commit", "feat(STORY-" keywords (conventional commits) | `parser.go:86` |
| Signal Detected | Full buffer regex scan for `<promise>` or `<spectrum-*>` | `parser.go:94` |

### Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Claude CLI not in PATH | `exec.Command` fails immediately, TUI transitions to Error state with no automatic retry or PATH search fallback |
| Claude process error | Increment `ConsecutiveErrs`, backoff = `errs × 2s`, retry |
| 3+ consecutive errors | Transition to `StateError`, stop execution |
| Signal: error | Immediate `StateError` |
| Signal: retry | Increment errors, retry if under limit (3) |
| Signal: complete (but stories remain) | Override signal, log warning, continue |
| Max iterations reached | Transition to `StateMaxIterations` |
| Claude timeout | 30 minutes per session |

### Process Termination

- **Windows**: `taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>` (tree kill)
- **Unix**: `cmd.Process.Kill()` (direct kill)

---

## Terminal Detection

The terminal detection system (`terminal/`) automatically identifies the user's environment and adapts the UI accordingly.

### Detection Capabilities

| Detection | Method | Fallback |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Terminal type | Environment variables (priority-ordered) | `"Terminal"` |
| Shell | `PSModulePath`/`COMSPEC` (Windows), `$SHELL` (Unix) | `"unknown"` |
| Color profile | `COLORTERM` env, `termenv` profile | `"TrueColor"` |
| Background color | OSC 11, settings.json, theme file, lookup table | `#0A0910` |
| Nerd Font | IDE settings.json `fontFamily` contains "Nerd" | `false` |
| Git branch | `.git/HEAD` parsing | `""` |
| Accent color | IDE color customizations, theme file, lookup table | `#607088` |
| Editor background | IDE color customizations, theme file, lookup table | `#2c2d3a` |

### Supported Terminals

| Terminal | Detection Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cursor | `CURSOR_TRACE_ID` / `CURSOR_EXTENSION_HOST_ROLE` |
| Windsurf | `WINDSURF_PID` |
| VS Code | `VSCODE_PID` / `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode` |
| Windows Terminal | `WT_SESSION` |
| WezTerm | `WEZTERM_PANE` |
| iTerm2 | `ITERM_SESSION_ID` / `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` |
| Alacritty | `ALACRITTY_WINDOW_ID` |
| Kitty | `KITTY_WINDOW_ID` |
| Hyper | `TERM_PROGRAM=Hyper` |
| Terminal.app | `TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal` |
| ConEmu | `ConEmuPID` |

### Theme Adaptation

For IDE terminals (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), the system:

1. Reads `settings.json` (platform-specific path, JSONC-comment-stripped)
2. Extracts `workbench.colorTheme` and `colorCustomizations`
3. Finds matching theme extension files for accent/background colors
4. Falls back to a lookup table of 19 known themes
5. Applies `styles.ApplyTheme(accentHex)` to override Primary color and rebuild cached styles
6. Applies `styles.ApplySecondary(editorBgHex)` to match inactive tab backgrounds
7. Computes atmosphere color for splash screen blending

---

## Diff System

The diff system (`diff/`) provides parsing and rendering of unified diffs with syntax highlighting.

### Features

- **Unified and side-by-side** view modes
- **Word-level diffs** for consecutive add/remove pairs
- **Syntax highlighting** via Chroma (monokai theme)
- **Line numbers** with dual-gutter (old + new)
- **Horizontal scrolling** and **word wrapping** modes

### Diff Colors

| Element | Color | Background |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Added line | Green `#10B981` | Dark green `#1a3a2a` |
| Removed line | Red `#EF4444` | Dark red `#3a1a1a` |
| Context line | Gray `#6B7280` | — |
| Word diff (add) | Green, Bold | Dark green `#1a3a2a` |
| Word diff (remove) | Red, Bold | Dark red `#3a1a1a` |
| Hunk header | Blue `#3B82F6`, Bold | — |
| Line numbers | Gray `#6B7280` | — |

## File Watcher

The `watcher/` package provides real-time file change detection using `fsnotify`, enabling auto-refresh across plugins.

### Architecture

```
Project Directory
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  fsnotify.Watcher │  Recursive directory watching
│  (all subdirs)    │  Auto-adds newly created directories
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
    fs event
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  Ignore Filter    │  Skips: .git, node_modules, vendor,
│                   │  dist, build, __pycache__, .cache,
│                   │  hidden dirs (except .prism)
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  Debounce         │  Per-path timer (default 500ms)
│  (time.Timer map) │  Resets on repeated events
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  EventBus.Publish │  FileChangedEvent{FilePath, Action}
│                   │  Action: "created", "modified", "deleted"
└──────────────────┘
```

### Configuration

- **Default debounce**: 500ms
- **Functional options**: `WithDebounce(duration)`, `WithIgnoreFunc(fn)`
- **Thread-safe**: Uses `sync.Mutex` for timer map access
- **Lifecycle**: `Start()` walks directory tree, `Stop()` cancels all timers and closes watcher

Subscribers: Git plugin (auto-refresh status), Files plugin (tree refresh), Browser plugin (artifact scanning).

## Persisted UI State

The `state/` package provides per-project UI state persistence across sessions.

### Storage

State files are stored at `~/.config/prism-cli/state/<project-hash>.json`. The hash is SHA-256 of the project directory path (first 12 hex characters).

### Schema

```go
type ProjectState struct {
    ActivePlugin string                    // Last active tab
    Files        FilesPersistedState       // Open tabs, expanded directories, sidebar width
    Git          GitPersistedState         // Sidebar width, diff view mode
    Workspaces   WorkspacesPersistedState  // Linked tasks (worktree path → story ID)
}
```

### Operations

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NewStore(configDir)` | Creates store rooted at config directory; empty `configDir` makes all operations no-ops |
| `Load(projectDir)` | Reads state for project; returns zero-value on missing/corrupt file |
| `Save(projectDir, state)` | Writes state atomically as indented JSON |

Thread-safe via `sync.RWMutex`.

---

## Global Workspace Registry

The `registry/` package manages `~/.prism/workspaces.json` for cross-directory project discovery.

### Schema

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": "/Users/demo/project",
      "name": "project",
      "lastAccessed": "2026-03-02T14:00:00Z",
      "version": "2.5.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Operations

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Register(projectDir, version)` | Add/update project entry (called on TUI exit from `main.go`) |
| `LoadAll()` | Read all registered projects |
| `Prune()` | Remove entries where `.prism/` no longer exists on disk |

### Cross-Process Safety

Uses an exclusive lockfile at `~/.prism/workspaces.json.lock`:
- Retries up to 10 times with 50ms delay
- Removes stale lock and retries once on failure
- Windows paths are lowercased via `normalizePath()` for case-insensitive deduplication

The Workspaces plugin reads from this registry to discover projects across different directories (not just siblings).

## Vertical Layout & Height Budget

### Critical: lipgloss `Height()` Semantic

**`Height(h)` sets the INNER (content) height, not the outer frame height.**

Despite the v1 migration guide claiming Width/Height are "outer dimensions including borders and padding," the actual implementation in lipgloss (v1.1.1-pre) applies `Height()` to content BEFORE `applyBorder()`:

```go
// lipgloss style.go Render() order of operations:
// 1. alignTextVertical(str, verticalAlign, height, nil)  ← pads content to `height` lines
// 2. alignTextHorizontal(str, horizontalAlign, width, st)
// 3. s.applyBorder(str)                                   ← adds 2 lines (top + bottom border)
// 4. MaxHeight truncation (AFTER border)
```

This means for any style with `Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder())`:

| Code | Inner Lines | Outer Lines |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `style.Height(h).Render(content)` | `h` | `h + 2` |
| `style.Height(h - 2).Render(content)` | `h - 2` | `h` |

**Rule: To get a bordered panel of exactly `h` outer lines, use `Height(h - 2)`.**

Additionally, `alignTextVertical` does NOT truncate — if content exceeds the Height setting, the content is returned as-is, and the border wraps around the full content. Use `MaxHeight()` if truncation is needed.

### App Shell Chrome Heights

```
Terminal Height (m.Height)
├── Tab Bar:  3 lines (PowerlineTabHeight) or 2 lines (CompactTabHeight)
├── Content:  m.Height - tabBarHeight - FooterHeight  (via contentHeight())
└── Footer:   3 lines (FooterHeight)
    ├── Tier 1: Key hints (BorderTop + content = 2 lines)
    └── Tier 2: Powerline status bar (1 line)
```

Constants in `shell.go`:
```go
const (
    FooterHeight       = 3  // key hints border+content (2) + powerline bar (1)
    PowerlineTabHeight = 3  // 3-line diagonal slant tab bar
    CompactTabHeight   = 2  // 1-line tabs + separator rule
)
```

### Per-Plugin Height Budgets

Each plugin receives `(width, height)` where `height = contentHeight()`. The plugin must render exactly `height` visual lines.

**Spectrum** (`plugin_spectrum.go`):
```
height
├── header (measured):         3 lines (PanelStyle border around 1-line content)
├── progressBar (measured):    3 lines (PanelStyle border around 1-line content)
├── mainPanels (dynamic):      dynamicHeight * 60%
│   ├── storyList:             PanelStyle.Height(h-2) → outer = h
│   └── activityPanel:         PanelStyle.Height(h-2) → outer = h
├── logPanel (dynamic):        dynamicHeight - mainPanelHeight
│   └── PanelStyle.Height(h-2) → outer = h
└── statusBar:                 1 line (no border)

fixedHeight = epicHeight + headerHeight + progressHeight + 1
dynamicHeight = height - fixedHeight
```

**Monitor** (`plugin_monitor.go`):
```
height
├── breadcrumb:     1 line (renderBreadcrumb)
├── blank:          1 line
├── 3 panels:       contentHeight = height - 4  (JoinHorizontal)
│   ├── healthPanel:    Height(cH-2) → outer = cH
│   ├── historyPanel:   Height(cH-2) → outer = cH
│   └── gatesPanel:     Height(cH-2) → outer = cH
├── blank:          1 line
└── footer:         1 line
```

**Agent** (`plugin_agent.go`):
```
height
├── breadcrumb:      1 line
├── blank:           1 line
└── wideMode/compact:  height - 2
    ├── sidebar:       Height(h-2) → outer = h  (pad content to h-2 lines)
    └── chatArea:      h lines total
        ├── historyBordered:  Height(historyH) inner → outer = historyH + 2
        ├── blank:            1 line
        └── inputBordered:    5 lines (3 content + 2 border, no Height set)
        historyH = h - 8  →  (h-8+2) + 1 + 5 = h
```

### Panel Height Pattern (Correct)

When creating bordered panels that must fill a specific outer height:

```go
// CORRECT: outer = height lines
styles.PanelStyle.Width(width).Height(height - 2).Render(content)

// WRONG: outer = height + 2 lines (overflows!)
styles.PanelStyle.Width(width).Height(height).Render(content)
```

For manual border styles (not using PanelStyle):
```go
// CORRECT:
lipgloss.NewStyle().
    Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).
    Width(width).
    Height(height - 2).  // inner = height-2, outer = height
    Render(content)

// Pad content to fill inner area:
for len(lines) < height-2 {
    lines = append(lines, "")
}
```

### Resize Handler Consistency

The `PluginResizeMsg.Height` carries `contentHeight()` (total content area). Plugin resize handlers must subtract the same overhead as their `View()` method to derive the viewport height:

```go
// Agent example:
// View: breadcrumb(2) + history_border(2) + blank(1) + input(5) = 10
case plugin.PluginResizeMsg:
    viewportHeight := msg.Height - 10
```

### Version Injection

The CLI version is injected at build time via `-ldflags`. The source of truth is the `VERSION` file at the repository root (see [Centralized Version Management](#centralized-version-management-v243)):

```bash
VERSION := $(shell cat ../../VERSION 2>/dev/null || git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo "dev")
LDFLAGS := -X main.version=$(VERSION)
```

### `src/core/task/` — Task Execution Subsystem

The task subsystem handles tool execution during chat sessions:

```
src/core/task/
├── index.ts              # Task module entry
├── task-state.ts         # Task state management
├── message-state.ts      # Message state management
└── tools/
    ├── coordinator.ts    # Tool coordinator
    ├── types.ts          # Tool type definitions
    └── handlers/
        ├── read-file.ts
        ├── write-file.ts
        ├── edit-file.ts
        ├── execute-command.ts
        ├── search-files.ts
        ├── list-files.ts
        ├── ask-followup.ts
        └── attempt-completion.ts
```

### Walkthroughs

The extension defines a walkthrough `prism.gettingStarted` in `package.json` with 4 steps:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `welcome` | Welcome to Prism |
| `init-prism` | Initialize `.prism/` directory |
| `configure-claude` | Configure Claude CLI |
| `first-research` | Run your first research |

---

## Core Orchestrator — PrismController

The `PrismController` is the central hub that ties together all extension functionality.

### Responsibilities

| Area | Components | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **State** | `updateState()`, `PrismExtensionState` | Atomic state updates, broadcast to all webview subscribers via gRPC streams |
| **Workflow** | `WorkflowStateMachine` | Phase transitions with validation (Idle → Research → Plan → Implement → Validate) |
| **Stories** | `StoriesManager` | Load/save `stories.json`, resolve dependencies, track progress |
| **Chat** | `ClaudeRunner`, tool handlers | Spawn Claude CLI with `--output-format stream-json`, handle tool use recursively |
| **Spectrum** | `SpectrumEngine`, `SpectrumRunner` | Execution loop state machine, per-iteration CLI subprocess management |
| **Skills** | `ModeBridge`, `PluginBridge` | Switch between SDK chat and CLI plugin mode, route skill invocations |
| **Files** | `PrismWatcher` | Monitor `.prism/` directory for changes, fire `onDidChangeFile` events |
| **Office** | `AgentBridge` | Connect Spectrum sessions to Office agent characters |

### Extension State Model (`PrismExtensionState`)

The full state is broadcast to all webview subscribers on every update:

| Category | Fields | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Workspace** | `hasPrismDir`, `hasStoriesJson`, `prismDir`, `storiesPath` | `.prism/` detection |
| **Workflow** | `workflowPhase`, `workflowContext` | Current phase + active document/story |
| **Stories** | `stories[]`, `plan`, `completedCount`, `remainingCount` | Story data + progress |
| **Chat** | `chatMessages[]`, `isChatStreaming`, `hasActiveTask`, `pendingApprovalToolUseId` | Conversation state |
| **CLI** | `chatMode` (`sdk`/`plugin`), `activePluginSkill`, `hasClaudeCli` | CLI bridge state |
| **Spectrum** | `executionState`, `currentIteration`, `currentStoryId`, `progress`, `elapsedMs`, `consecutiveErrors`, `lastSignalType`, `recentActivities[]`, `logs[]` | Full execution state |
| **Office** | `office.enabled`, `office.agentCount`, `office.activeAgents[]` | Agent tracking |
| **Config** | `defaultModel`, `planningModel` | Model selections |

### Events

| Event | Trigger | Consumers |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `onDidChangeFile` | `.prism/` file added/changed/deleted | Tree providers |
| `onDidChangeState` | Any state update | Status bar, webviews |
| `onDidStartSession` | Claude session begins | AgentBridge |
| `onDidUpdateStory` | Story status changes | Stories tree |
| `onDidEndSpectrumStory` | Story iteration completes | Monitor history |

---

## IPC Architecture — gRPC-over-postMessage

Communication between the extension host and webviews uses a gRPC-inspired protocol over VS Code's `postMessage` API.

### Pattern

1. Extension host defines gRPC service interfaces
2. Webview sends binary-like requests via `postMessage`
3. Host responds with serialized state objects
4. Streaming RPCs push state updates on every `updateState()` call

### Services

| Service | Methods | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|------|-------------|
| **StateService** | `subscribeToState()` | Streaming | Push state on init + every update |
| | `getState()` | Unary | Get current state once |
| **UiService** | `initializeWebview()` | Unary | Called on webview mount |
| | `initPrism()` | Unary | Initialize `.prism/` from UI |
| **WorkflowService** | `transition()` | Unary | Attempt phase change |
| | `getAvailableTransitions()` | Unary | List allowed next phases |
| **ChatService** | `sendMessage()` | Unary | Send user text, start streaming |
| | `abortTask()` | Unary | Stop active chat/plugin |
| | `clearMessages()` | Unary | Reset chat history |
| | `approveToolUse()` | Unary | Approve pending tool use |
| | `setApiKey()` | Unary | No-op (using CLI) |
| **PluginService** | `executeSkill()` | Unary | Run Prism plugin skill via CLI |
| **SpectrumService** | `start()` | Unary | Begin autonomous execution |
| | `pause()` / `resume()` | Unary | Pause/resume loop |
| | `stop()` | Unary | Halt execution |
| | `skipStory()` | Unary | Skip current story |
| | `reset()` | Unary | Reset Spectrum state |
| **TaskService** | `readFile()`, `writeFile()`, `editFile()` | Unary | File operations during chat |
| | `executeCommand()`, `searchFiles()`, `listFiles()` | Unary | Tool operations |
| | `askFollowup()`, `attemptCompletion()` | Unary | Task lifecycle |

## Workflow State Machine (VS Code)

The extension implements the same 4-phase workflow as the CLI, with validated transitions:

```
              ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
              │                                      │
              │    ┌──────┐                          │
              │    │ IDLE │                          │
              │    └──┬───┘                          │
              │       │                              │
              │  ┌────┴─────┬──────────┬──────────┐  │
              │  ▼          ▼          ▼          ▼  │
              │ Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
              │  │          │          │          │  │
              │  └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘  │
              │       (any phase can return to Idle)  │
              └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each phase transition is validated by the `WorkflowStateMachine`. The active phase determines:
- System prompts sent to Claude
- Status bar indicator color
- Available actions in the sidebar

---

## Spectrum Execution (VS Code)

The VS Code extension runs Spectrum through the same signal protocol as the CLI.

### Execution States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `idle` | Waiting to start |
| `running` | Claude CLI active, processing stories |
| `paused` | Execution paused by user |
| `complete` | All stories finished |
| `maxIterations` | Iteration limit reached |
| `error` | Fatal error, cannot continue |

### SpectrumEngine

Manages the execution loop state machine. On each iteration:

1. Check max iterations — exceeded? → `maxIterations` state
2. Select next story via `StoriesManager.getNextStory()`
3. Spawn Claude CLI via `SpectrumRunner`
4. Stream output, parse tools and signals
5. Handle signal: Continue → pause, then next iteration; Complete → check remaining; Error → stop
6. Update stories.json on disk

### SpectrumRunner

Per-iteration CLI subprocess manager:
- Spawns `claude` with `--dangerously-skip-permissions --print --output-format stream-json`
- Streams stdout/stderr through output parser
- Detects signals (`<spectrum-continue>`, `<spectrum-retry>`, `<spectrum-blocked>`, `<spectrum-error>`, `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`)
- Fires events: `recentActivities[]`, `logs[]`, signal detection

---

## Plugin Skill Integration

### ModeBridge

Detects when user messages reference Prism plugin skills and switches from SDK chat mode to CLI plugin mode:

| Chat Mode | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sdk` | Direct Claude Agent SDK chat (default) |
| `plugin` | CLI-based skill execution (auto-detected or manual) |

### PluginBridge

Routes skill invocations to the Claude CLI:

| Skill Name | CLI Command |
|------------|-------------|
| `prism-research` | `/prism-research` |
| `prism-plan` | `/prism-plan` |
| `prism-implement` | `/prism-implement` |
| `prism-validate` | `/prism-validate` |
| `commit` | `/commit` |
| `decompose_plan` | `/decompose_plan` |
| `create_handoff` | `/create_handoff` |
| `describe_pr` | `/describe_pr` |

### Skill Detection Flow

```
User types message in chat
    │
    ▼
ModeBridge.detectSkillTrigger(message)
    │
    ├── No match → SDK chat mode (Claude Agent SDK)
    │
    └── Match found → Switch to plugin mode
        │
        ▼
    PluginBridge.executeSkill(skillName)
        │
        ▼
    ClaudeRunner.spawn("claude ... /skill-name")
        │
        ▼
    OutputParser → stream tools + signals to UI
```

## Office Visualization

The Office view provides a pixel-art visualization of AI agents working in a virtual office.

### Components

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Office Canvas | `OfficeCanvas.tsx` | Main 2D Canvas renderer with game loop |
| Engine | `engine/` | Game loop tick, character animation, matrix effects |
| Sprites | `sprites/` | Character sprite sheets, PNG decoding, animation frames |
| Layout | `layout/` | Furniture catalog, tile mapping, serialization |
| Editor | `office/editor/` | Interactive furniture placement editor |

### Agent States

| State | Icon | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Active | `●` | Currently executing tool calls |
| Thinking | `◉` | Claude is generating response |
| Waiting | `○` | Idle, waiting for next task |
| Paused | `⏸` | Execution paused |

### Agent Lifecycle

1. Spectrum starts a story iteration → `AgentBridge` creates agent
2. Agent character appears in Office at assigned desk
3. Agent status updates in real-time as tools execute
4. Story completes → agent transitions to "done" state
5. Next iteration → new agent or reuse existing

# Part IV — Electron Desktop App

The Prism Electron app is a standalone desktop application that runs the same React UI and business logic as the VS Code extension, but independent of any IDE. It uses Electron's IPC model as the transport layer instead of VS Code's `postMessage`, and replaces all VS Code API dependencies with pure Node.js equivalents.

## Electron App Overview

The Electron app was built by wiring the existing platform-agnostic prism-vscode core + React UI into Electron's IPC model, then replacing the 8 VS Code-coupled files with Electron equivalents.

### What's Shared (from prism-vscode / packages)

- All business logic: workflow state machine, spectrum engine, stories manager, signal parser (via `@prism-core`)
- All Claude CLI integration: runner, parser, events (via `@prism-core`)
- All React UI components: ChatView, SpectrumView, WelcomeView, MarkdownBlock, and all sub-components (via `@prism-ui`)
- Office canvas engine: sprites, game loop, layout serialization, character FSM (via `@prism-ui`)
- The complete gRPC-over-postMessage protocol (unchanged)
- Service clients: StateService, ChatService, WorkflowService, PluginService, SpectrumService (via `@prism-ui`)

### What Differs (platform shell)

| Concern | VS Code | Electron |
|---------|---------|----------|
| IPC transport | `webview.postMessage` / `onDidReceiveMessage` | `ipcMain.handle()` / `ipcRenderer.invoke()` |
| Workspace detection | `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` | `dialog.showOpenDialog` + stored project dir |
| File watching | `vscode.FileSystemWatcher` | `chokidar` |
| File I/O | `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` | Node.js `fs/promises` |
| Config storage | VS Code settings API | Plain JSON file in `app.getPath('userData')` |
| Event system | `vscode.EventEmitter` | Node.js `EventEmitter` |
| Context keys | `vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', ...)` | Not applicable (no-op) |

### Key Features (Electron)

- **V2 IDE shell** with ActivityBar, ContentRail, TabBar, BottomPanel, and BottomStatusBar
- Full Prism chat interface with streaming Claude CLI responses (pinned chat tab)
- Spectrum autonomous execution dashboard with real-time story updates
- **6 activity panels**: Files, Stories, Git (left rail); Monitor, Spectrum, Workspaces (right rail)
- **Tab-based editor**: StoryDetailView, FileContentView, GitGraphView with pinned chat
- **FloatingChatPill**: Pulsing gradient pill for quick access when not on chat tab
- Native OS menu bar (File → Open Project, standard Edit/View/Window)
- Window state persistence (bounds, last project directory) + layout state persistence
- CLI argument support: `prism-electron /path/to/project`
- Context-isolated renderer with Electron Fuses security hardening
- Distributable installers via Electron Forge (Squirrel Windows, ZIP macOS, deb/rpm Linux)

```

### Import Strategy

The Electron app imports shared business logic using TypeScript path aliases with a **dual-path fallback** — it checks `packages/prism-core/src` first, then falls back to `../prism-vscode/src`:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "paths": {
    "@prism-core/*": ["../../packages/prism-core/src/*", "../prism-vscode/src/*"]
  }
}
```

```typescript
// vite.main.config.mts — custom plugin with dual resolution
function prismCoreAliasPlugin() {
  // Checks packages/prism-core/src first, falls back to ../prism-vscode/src
}
```

Additionally, a **`@prism-ui/*` alias** provides access to shared React components:

```json
// webview-ui/tsconfig.json
{
  "paths": {
    "@prism-ui/*": ["../../../packages/prism-ui/src/*"]
  }
}
```

Both `webview-ui/vite.config.ts` and `vite.renderer.config.mts` set up the same `@prism-ui` alias. This means both apps remain independently buildable while sharing all platform-agnostic code.

## Main Process & Window Management

### `src/main.ts`

The main process handles Electron app lifecycle, window creation, native menus, and CLI argument handling.

#### Bootstrap Flow

1. Check for Squirrel Windows installer events (`electron-squirrel-startup`)
2. Load saved window state from `prism-window-state.json`
3. Create `BrowserWindow` with saved bounds (fallback: 1200×800)
4. Wire `ElectronIPCBridge` to the window
5. Load initial project from CLI argument or last saved project dir
6. Set native application menu
7. Load renderer (Vite dev server URL or packaged HTML)

#### Window Configuration

```typescript
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: savedState?.width ?? 1200,
  height: savedState?.height ?? 800,
  x: savedState?.x,
  y: savedState?.y,
  webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
    contextIsolation: true,    // Security: renderer can't access Node.js
    nodeIntegration: false,    // Security: no require() in renderer
  },
});
```

#### Native Menu

```
File
├── Open Project…    (CmdOrCtrl+O)  →  bridge.openProject()
├── ─────────────
└── Quit             (CmdOrCtrl+Q)  →  app.quit()

Edit     →  Standard editMenu role (cut/copy/paste/undo/redo)
View     →  Standard viewMenu role (reload/devtools/zoom)
Window   →  Standard windowMenu role (minimize/close)
```

#### CLI Argument Support

```bash
# Open project directly
prism-electron /path/to/project

# Packaged: args start at argv[1]
# Dev mode: args start at argv[2] (after electron + entry script)
```

The first valid filesystem path in `argv` is treated as the initial project directory. Falls back to `lastProjectDir` from saved state.

#### Window Lifecycle

- `close` event: Save window bounds + current project dir to `prism-window-state.json`
- `closed` event: Dispose `ElectronIPCBridge` (terminates Claude processes)
- `window-all-closed`: Quit on Windows/Linux; stay open on macOS (Darwin convention)
- `activate`: Recreate window on macOS dock click when no windows exist

#### DevTools

```typescript
if (!app.isPackaged) {
  mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
}
```

DevTools only open in development mode. Production builds suppress them.

---

## Preload & Context Bridge

### `src/preload.ts`

The preload script runs in a privileged context between main and renderer. It exposes a minimal, safe API via `contextBridge`:

```typescript
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  send:   (channel: string, data: unknown) => ipcRenderer.send(channel, data),
  on:     (channel: string, cb: (data: unknown) => void) => {
    const wrapped = (_: Electron.IpcRendererEvent, data: unknown) => cb(data);
    ipcRenderer.on(channel, wrapped);
    return () => ipcRenderer.removeListener(channel, wrapped);
  },
  invoke: (channel: string, data?: unknown) => ipcRenderer.invoke(channel, data),
});
```

#### API Surface

| Method | Pattern | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `send(channel, data)` | Fire-and-forget | Rarely used in Prism |
| `on(channel, callback)` | Listen for events | `grpc_response` stream from main |
| `invoke(channel, data)` | Request-response | `grpc_request`, `prism:openProject`, `shell:openExternal`, etc. |
| `officeMessage(callback)` | Listen for events | Subscribe to office messages from main process |
| `officeAction(msg)` | Fire-and-forget | Send office actions to main process |

#### Type Declaration

```typescript
declare global {
  interface Window {
    electronAPI: {
      send: (channel: string, data: unknown) => void;
      on: (channel: string, cb: (data: unknown) => void) => () => void;
      invoke: (channel: string, data?: unknown) => Promise<unknown>;
      officeMessage: (callback: (data: unknown) => void) => () => void;
      officeAction: (msg: unknown) => void;
    };
  }
}
```

## IPC Bridge — Electron Transport

### `src/hosts/electron/ElectronIPCBridge.ts`

The IPC Bridge does what `VscodeWebviewProvider.ts` does in the VS Code extension: instantiates the controller, registers IPC handlers, and wires bidirectional communication.

#### Registered IPC Handlers

**Core handlers:**

| Channel | Method | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `grpc_request` | `handle` | Routes gRPC requests to `handleGrpcRequest()` → controller handlers |
| `grpc_request_cancel` | `handle` | Removes streaming subscriber by `request_id` |
| `prism:openProject` | `handle` | Opens native folder picker → `setProjectDir()` |
| `shell:openExternal` | `handle` | Opens external URLs in system browser |

**File and Git handlers:**

| Channel | Method | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `prism:readFile` | `handle` | Read file content (with path traversal protection) |
| `prism:fileTree` | `handle` | Recursive file tree (depth-limited) |
| `prism:gitStatus` | `handle` | Git status via child_process |
| `prism:gitLog` | `handle` | Git log with formatted output |
| `prism:gitBranchInfo` | `handle` | Branch + ahead/behind info |

**Workspace and project handlers:**

| Channel | Method | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `prism:getApiKey` | `handle` | Retrieve stored API key |
| `prism:setApiKey` | `handle` | Store API key (via ElectronSecretStorage) |
| `prism:deleteApiKey` | `handle` | Remove stored API key |

**Layout persistence handlers:**

| Channel | Method | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|

#### Bidirectional Communication

```
Renderer → Main:  ipcRenderer.invoke('grpc_request', payload)
                  → ipcMain.handle('grpc_request', handler)

Main → Renderer:  mainWindow.webContents.send('grpc_response', msg)
                  → ipcRenderer.on('grpc_response', callback)
```

#### Response Routing

The bridge creates a `postMessage` function that routes all responses through the Electron IPC channel:

```typescript
this.controller.setPostMessageFn(async (msg) => {
  mainWindow.webContents.send('grpc_response', msg);
});
```

This replaces `webview.postMessage(msg)` from the VS Code extension with an equivalent Electron pattern.

#### Project Management

The bridge tracks the current project directory and exposes:
- `openProject()`: Show native folder picker → set project dir
- `setProjectDir(dir)`: Directly set project dir (used by CLI args and saved state)
- `currentProjectDir`: Getter for current project path

## ElectronPrismController

### `src/hosts/electron/ElectronPrismController.ts`

A thin platform shell (45 lines) that extends `BasePrismController` from `packages/prism-core/`. The bulk of orchestration logic (state management, services, handler routing) now lives in the base class. This file provides only Electron-specific overrides.

### VSCode API Replacements

| VSCode API | Electron Replacement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `vscode.EventEmitter` | Node.js `EventEmitter` |
| `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` | Stored `_projectDir` string via `setProjectDir()` |
| `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` | `fs.stat()` from `fs/promises` |
| `vscode.FileSystemWatcher` | `PrismWatcher` (chokidar) |
| `vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', ...)` | No-op (context keys not applicable) |
| `vscode.window.showInformationMessage` | Not needed (UI handles all messaging) |

### Services

| Service | Class | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Workflow | `WorkflowStateMachine` | Research → Plan → Implement → Validate state machine |
| Stories | `StoriesManager` | Load/parse stories.json, track completion |
| Watcher | `PrismWatcher` | chokidar-based file system monitoring for `.prism/` |
| Chat | `ClaudeRunner` | Spawn Claude CLI for chat sessions |
| Skills | `ModeBridge` | Route `/skill-name` commands to Claude CLI |
| Spectrum | `SpectrumEngine` + `SpectrumRunner` | Autonomous story execution loop |

### Handler Registry

All handlers are registered in `_registerHandlers()` and dispatched via `handleGrpcRequest()`:

#### StateService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `subscribeToState` | Streaming | Push state updates indefinitely to subscriber |
| `getState` | Unary | One-shot state fetch |

#### UiService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `initializeWebview` | Unary | Trigger `.prism/` detection, push initial state |
| `initPrism` | Unary | Create `.prism/` directory structure |

#### WorkflowService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `transition` | Unary | Move to next workflow phase |
| `getAvailableTransitions` | Unary | Query valid transitions from current state |

#### ChatService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `sendMessage` | Unary | Route message to Claude CLI or plugin skill |
| `abortTask` | Unary | Terminate running chat session |
| `clearMessages` | Unary | Reset chat history |

#### PluginService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `executeSkill` | Unary | Run `/skill-name` via ModeBridge → Claude CLI |
| `terminateSkill` | Unary | Stop running skill |
| `checkCli` | Unary | Verify Claude CLI is on PATH |
| `getSkills` | Unary | List available Prism plugin skills |

#### SpectrumService

| Handler | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `start` | Unary | Begin autonomous story execution loop |
| `pause` | Unary | Pause execution |
| `resume` | Unary | Resume paused execution |
| `stop` | Unary | Stop execution |
| `skipStory` | Unary | Mark current story as SKIPPED, advance |
| `reset` | Unary | Reset execution state |

### State Management

The controller maintains a `PrismExtensionState` object and broadcasts changes to all subscribers:

```typescript
async updateState(partial: Partial<PrismExtensionState>): Promise<void> {
  Object.assign(this._state, partial);
  this._broadcastState();
}
```

Subscribers are tracked by `request_id`. Dead subscribers are auto-cleaned on send failure.

### Key Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `setProjectDir(dir)` | Set active project, trigger `.prism/` re-detection, start watcher |
| `updateState(partial)` | Merge partial state, broadcast to all subscribers |
| `setPhase(phase)` | Force workflow phase transition |
| `_detectPrismDir()` | Check for `.prism/`, detect stories.json, start file watcher |
| `_onPrismFileChange(event)` | React to stories.json changes, reload stories |
| `_runChatSession(text)` | Spawn ClaudeRunner, stream text + tool events |
| `_startSpectrumLoop(config)` | Initialize SpectrumEngine, begin iteration loop |
| `dispose()` | Terminate all runners, close watchers, clean up subscribers |

---

## Platform Modules (Electron)

> **Note**: The `src/prism/config.ts` (79 lines), `src/prism/watcher.ts` (72 lines), and `src/prism/init.ts` (50 lines) modules have been extracted to `packages/prism-core/src/prism/` and are now consumed via `@prism-core/*` aliases. The descriptions below document their functionality as it exists in the shared package.

### `src/prism/config.ts` — Directory Detection

Replaces `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` with pure Node.js:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';
import * as path from 'path';

export async function detectPrismDir(projectDir: string): Promise<string | undefined> {
  const candidate = path.join(projectDir, '.prism');
  try {
    await fs.stat(candidate);
    return candidate;
  } catch {
    return undefined;
  }
}

export async function detectStoriesPath(prismDir: string): Promise<string | undefined> {
  const candidate = path.join(prismDir, 'stories', 'stories.json');
  try {
    await fs.stat(candidate);
    return candidate;
  } catch {
    return undefined;
  }
}
```

Also provides `getPrismConfig(prismDir)` which builds a `PrismConfig` object with all subdirectory paths (research, plans, validation, spectrum, handoffs, etc.).

### `src/prism/watcher.ts` — File Watching

Replaces `vscode.FileSystemWatcher` with chokidar:

```typescript
export class PrismWatcher extends EventEmitter {
  private _watcher: FSWatcher | null = null;

  start(prismDir: string): void {
    this.dispose();
    this._watcher = chokidar.watch(prismDir, {
      ignoreInitial: true,
      awaitWriteFinish: true,
      persistent: false,
    });
    this._watcher.on('all', (event, filePath) => {
      const type = this._classify(prismDir, filePath);
      this.emit('change', { type, filePath });
    });
  }
}
```

File changes are classified into categories:

| Category | Pattern | Triggers |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `stories` | `stories/*` | Stories reload |
| `research` | `shared/research/*` | Research list refresh |
| `plans` | `shared/plans/*` | Plans list refresh |
| `validation` | `shared/validation/*` | Validation refresh |
| `spectrum` | `shared/spectrum/*` | Spectrum progress update |
| `other` | Everything else | No specific action |

### `src/prism/init.ts` — Directory Initialization

Creates the full `.prism/` directory structure:

```
.prism/
├── stories/
├── shared/
│   ├── research/
│   ├── plans/
│   ├── validation/
│   ├── spectrum/
│   ├── handoffs/
│   ├── prs/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── ref/
└── local/            ← .gitignore written here
```

Extracted from prism-vscode's `prism/init.ts` to avoid a transitive `vscode` import (the original file co-locates `initPrismDirInWorkspace` which depends on `vscode.workspace`).

---

## Webview UI — React SPA

### Transport Adapter (`webview-ui/src/electron.ts`)

The transport adapter is a drop-in replacement for VS Code's `vscode.ts`. It bridges the React SPA to Electron's IPC system using a re-dispatch pattern:

```typescript
// Inbound: Main → Renderer
window.electronAPI.on('grpc_response', (data) => {
  // Re-dispatch as a standard window "message" event
  // so grpc-client-base.ts works without modification
  window.dispatchEvent(new MessageEvent('message', { data }));
});

// Outbound: Renderer → Main
export const electronApi = {
  postMessage: (message: unknown) => {
    const msg = message as { type: string; grpc_request?: unknown; grpc_request_cancel?: unknown };
    if (msg.type === 'grpc_request') {
      window.electronAPI.invoke('grpc_request', msg.grpc_request);
    } else if (msg.type === 'grpc_request_cancel') {
      window.electronAPI.invoke('grpc_request_cancel', msg.grpc_request_cancel);
    }
  },
};
```

The re-dispatch pattern is key: by converting IPC responses into standard `window.dispatchEvent(new MessageEvent(...))` events, the entire `grpc-client-base.ts` works without any modification. The only change needed was swapping the import from `../vscode` to `../electron`.

### gRPC Client Base (`webview-ui/src/services/grpc-client-base.ts`)

The `ProtoBusClient` abstract base implements unary and streaming RPC over the postMessage protocol:

#### Unary Requests
1. Generate UUID4 `request_id`
2. Set up `window.addEventListener('message', handler)`
3. Post request via `electronApi.postMessage()`
4. Wait for response with matching `request_id`
5. Resolve/reject promise, remove listener

#### Streaming Requests
1. Same setup as unary
2. Keep listener active until `is_streaming === false`
3. Call `callbacks.onResponse()` for each message
4. Call `callbacks.onComplete()` on stream end
5. Return unsubscribe function (removes listener + sends cancel)

### Service Clients (`webview-ui/src/services/grpc-client.ts`)

Stateless client classes extending `ProtoBusClient`:

| Client | Methods |
|--------|---------|
| `StateServiceClient` | `subscribeToState()` (streaming), `getState()` (unary) |
| `UiServiceClient` | `initializeWebview()`, `initPrism()` |
| `WorkflowServiceClient` | `transition(transition)`, `getAvailableTransitions()` |
| `ChatServiceClient` | `sendMessage(text)`, `abortTask()`, `clearMessages()`, `approveToolUse()` |
| `PluginServiceClient` | `executeSkill()`, `terminateSkill()`, `checkCli()`, `getSkills()` |
| `SpectrumServiceClient` | `start()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `skipStory()`, `reset()` |

### View Switcher (`webview-ui/src/App.tsx`)

The top-level component routes between views based on state:

```
No .prism/ dir detected  →  WelcomeView (with "Open Project…" button)
Chat mode active         →  ChatView (message list + input + phase selector)
Spectrum active          →  SpectrumView (progress bar + story list + logs)
```

### Theme (`webview-ui/src/theme/`)

All VS Code CSS custom properties (`--vscode-sideBar-background`, `--vscode-foreground`, etc.) were replaced with Prism-specific custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --prism-bg: #1a1b2e;
  --prism-fg: #e2e8f0;
  --prism-font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --prism-font-size: 13px;
  --prism-input-bg: #252640;
  --prism-input-border: #3a3b5c;
  --prism-button-bg: #6366f1;
  --prism-button-fg: #ffffff;
  /* ... spectral theme colors */
}
```

The `spectral.css` file was also cleaned: `body.vscode-light` and `body.vscode-high-contrast` selectors were removed since the Electron app uses a single dark theme.

---

## State Management (Electron)

### PrismExtensionState

The global state object mirrors the VS Code extension's state model exactly:

```typescript
interface PrismExtensionState {
  // Config
  version: string;
  didHydrateState: boolean;
  hasClaudeCli: boolean;

  // Project
  hasPrismDir: boolean;
  hasStoriesJson: boolean;
  prismDir?: string;
  storiesPath?: string;

  // Workflow
  workflowPhase: 'idle' | 'research' | 'plan' | 'implement' | 'validate';
  defaultModel: string;
  planningModel: string;

  // Stories
  stories: PrismStory[];
  plan?: PrismPlan;
  completedCount: number;
  remainingCount: number;

  // Chat
  chatMessages: PrismChatMessage[];
  isChatStreaming: boolean;
  hasActiveTask: boolean;
  pendingApprovalToolUseId?: string;

  // CLI Mode
  chatMode: 'sdk' | 'plugin';
  activePluginSkill: string | null;

  // Spectrum
  spectrum: PrismSpectrumState;
}
```

### State Flow

```
ElectronPrismController
    │
    ├── updateState({ chatMessages: [...] })
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   Object.assign(this._state, partial)
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   _broadcastState()
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   for each subscriber (by request_id):
    │       mainWindow.webContents.send('grpc_response', {
    │         request_id,
    │         service: 'StateService',
    │         method: 'subscribeToState',
    │         payload: this._state,
    │         is_streaming: true
    │       })
    │
    ▼
PrismStateContext (React)
    │
    ├── onResponse callback updates state ref
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   setState(newState)  →  React re-render
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   ChatView / SpectrumView / WelcomeView re-render
```

### Hydration

The `didHydrateState` flag prevents a flash of default state on startup:

1. Renderer mounts → calls `UiServiceClient.initializeWebview()`
2. Main process detects `.prism/`, loads stories, resolves Claude CLI
3. Main pushes full state with `didHydrateState: true`
4. React components show loading state until `didHydrateState` is `true`

---

## Build & Packaging

### Scripts

```bash
cd apps/prism-electron

npm start           # Dev mode: Electron Forge + Vite HMR
npm run package     # Build production app (no installer)
npm run make        # Build distributable installers
npm run lint        # ESLint check
```

### Vite Build Targets

Electron Forge's Vite plugin builds three separate targets:

| Target | Config | Input | Output |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Main process | `vite.main.config.mts` | `src/main.ts` | `.vite/build/main.js` |
| Preload script | `vite.preload.config.mts` | `src/preload.ts` | `.vite/build/preload.js` |
| Renderer (SPA) | `vite.renderer.config.mts` | `webview-ui/index.html` | `.vite/renderer/main_window/` |

### Forge Config (`forge.config.ts`)

```typescript
// Plugins
plugins: [
  new VitePlugin({
    build: [
      { entry: 'src/main.ts', config: 'vite.main.config.mts', target: 'main' },
      { entry: 'src/preload.ts', config: 'vite.preload.config.mts', target: 'preload' },
    ],
    renderer: [
      { name: 'main_window', config: 'vite.renderer.config.mts' },
    ],
  }),
  new FusesPlugin({ /* security hardening */ }),
],

// Makers (installers)
makers: [
  MakerSquirrel,    // Windows: .exe + .nupkg + RELEASES
  MakerZIP,         // macOS: .zip
  MakerDeb,         // Linux: .deb
  MakerRPM,         // Linux: .rpm
]
```

### Build Output

```

├── Prism-win32-x64/              # Packaged app (npm run package)

        ├── Prism-2.4.9 Setup.exe
        ├── prism_electron-2.4.9-full.nupkg
        └── RELEASES
```

### Renderer Vite Config

The renderer has its own Vite configuration. The SPA source lives in `webview-ui/` but the Vite root stays at the project directory so the Forge Vite plugin outputs to `.vite/renderer/` at the project root — which gets packaged into the ASAR correctly.

```typescript
// vite.renderer.config.mts
export default defineConfig({
  // No custom root — keeps .vite/renderer/ output at project root for ASAR packaging
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  resolve: {
    alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'webview-ui/src') },
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: path.resolve(__dirname, 'webview-ui/index.html'),
    },
  },
});
```

> **v2.4.3 fix**: Previously `root: './webview-ui'` caused the renderer build output to land in `webview-ui/.vite/renderer/` instead of `.vite/renderer/`. The ASAR packager only included `.vite/` from the project root, resulting in a white screen on launch. The `loadFile` path in `main.ts` now uses `../renderer/main_window/webview-ui/index.html` to match the new output location.

---

## Security Hardening

### Context Isolation

The Electron app enforces strict process isolation:

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `contextIsolation` | `true` | Renderer cannot access Node.js APIs directly |
| `nodeIntegration` | `false` | No `require()` available in renderer |
| `sandbox` | default | Renderer runs in Chromium sandbox |

All communication between renderer and main process goes through the `contextBridge` preload script.

### Electron Fuses

Compile-time security toggles via `@electron/fuses`:

| Fuse | Setting | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `RunAsNode` | Disabled | Prevents `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` env var abuse |
| `EnableCookieEncryption` | Enabled | Encrypts cookies at rest |
| `EnableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable` | Disabled | Blocks `NODE_OPTIONS` injection |
| `EnableNodeCliInspectArguments` | Disabled | Blocks `--inspect` debugging in production |
| `OnlyLoadAppFromAsar` | Enabled | Only loads code from ASAR bundle (no filesystem bypass) |

### IPC Channel Restrictions

The preload script only forwards specific, known IPC channels. The renderer cannot send arbitrary messages to the main process — it can only use `send`, `on`, and `invoke` through the `electronAPI` bridge.

# Part V — Monorepo Architecture (v2.5.0)

The repository was restructured from two independent applications with fragile path aliases into a proper npm workspaces monorepo in v2.3.5, with continued refinements through v2.5.0. Shared packages (`@prism/core`, `@prism/ui`) contain all business logic and React components. A unified Tauri-based installer replaced the legacy NSIS approach in v2.4.7. The `prism-eval` Electron app and three new skills (`prism-eval`, `prism-release`, `prism-docs-update`) were added in v2.5.0.

### Infrastructure Notes

- `package.json` declares `"main": "src/index.ts"` and `"types": "src/index.ts"` but **`src/index.ts` does not exist** — this should be created or the declarations removed
- `tsconfig.json` has `noEmit: true` — no compiled output is produced, no `dist/` directory exists
- Dependencies: `uuid`, `chokidar`, `pngjs`
- DevDependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@types/uuid`, `@types/pngjs`
- Scripts: `build` and `typecheck` both run `tsc --noEmit`
- Zero test files across 42 source files

### Key Patterns

**BasePrismController** uses Node.js `EventEmitter` as drop-in for `vscode.EventEmitter`:
```typescript
controller.on('stateChange', (state) => ...)
controller.on('sessionStart', (data) => ...)
controller.on('storyUpdate', (data) => ...)
controller.on('spectrumStoryEnd', (data) => ...)
controller.on('fileChange', (path) => ...)
```

**Transport-agnostic gRPC handler**:
```typescript
handleGrpcRequest(
  postMessage: (msg: unknown) => Promise<void>,  // injected by platform
  request: GrpcRequest
)
```

## packages/prism-ui

**Package name**: `@prism/ui`  
**Purpose**: Shared React components and canvas office engine.

**TypeScript path alias**: `@prism-ui/*` → `../../../packages/prism-ui/src/*` (consumers are 3 levels deep from repo root)

### Infrastructure Notes

- `package.json` declares `"main": "src/index.ts"` and `"types": "src/index.ts"` but **`src/index.ts` does not exist**
- Dependencies: `react-markdown`, `react-virtuoso`, `rehype-highlight`, `remark-gfm`, `highlight.js`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `tailwind-merge`, `uuid`
- Peer deps: `react`, `react-dom`
- Scripts: `typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`
- Zero test files, no Storybook

### CSS Variable Bridge

13 shared components use `--prism-*` tokens mapped by platform:

```css
[data-platform="vscode"] {
  --prism-editor-background: var(--vscode-editor-background, #1e1e1e);
}
[data-platform="electron"] {
  --prism-editor-background: #0f1419;
}
```

### Office Canvas Engine

The office is a pure software renderer — no PNG images at runtime:
```
SpriteData = string[][]   // 2D array of hex colours, '' = transparent
```

**Platform transport adapter** (`src/office/transport.ts`):
```typescript
interface OfficeTransport {
  postMessage(msg: unknown): void
  onMessage(handler: (msg: unknown) => void): () => void
}
// VS Code:  setOfficeTransport({ postMessage: vscode.postMessage, ... })
// Electron: setOfficeTransport({ postMessage: electronAPI.send, ... })
```

## Platform Shell Responsibilities

| Responsibility | VS Code | Electron |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Window | `vscode.WebviewViewProvider` | `BrowserWindow` + `ipcMain` |
| Terminal/process | `vscode.Terminal` | `child_process.spawn` |
| Secret storage | `vscode.SecretStorage` | `safeStorage` (`ElectronSecretStorage`) |
| File watching | `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` | `chokidar` |
| Tree views | `vscode.TreeDataProvider` | React panels in `ContentRail` |
| Status bar | `vscode.StatusBarItem` | `BottomStatusBar.tsx` |

---

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Install all workspaces
npm install

# Type-check shared packages
cd packages/prism-core && npm run typecheck
cd packages/prism-ui   && npm run typecheck

# Build VS Code extension
cd apps/prism-vscode && npm run compile
cd apps/prism-vscode/webview-ui && npm run build

# Build Electron app
cd apps/prism-electron && npm run make
```

## Production Hardening (v2.4.1+)

| Area | Hardening |
|------|-----------|
| **Office renderer** | React `OfficeErrorBoundary` wraps `OfficeApp` in both platforms — canvas crash shows fallback UI with Retry |
| **Claude CLI detection** | `ElectronAgentManager` detects `ENOENT` spawn errors and shows user-friendly install instructions |
| **JSONL detection timeout** | 10-second timeout warns renderer if Claude transcript file never appears |
| **Layout persistence** | Validates parsed JSON is a non-null object; renames corrupted files to `.corrupted.<timestamp>` |
| **Layout watcher** | Validates external layout changes before forwarding to renderer |
| **Quality gate cancellation** | `executeGate` accepts `AbortSignal`; `prism:cancelGate` IPC; Cancel button in `MonitorPanel` |
| **Workspace discovery** | 50-entry sibling directory cap; graceful `git` not found; 5s/10s/15s git command timeouts |


## Centralized Version Management (v2.5.0)

Prior to v2.4.3, version strings were hardcoded in 14+ files across the monorepo and bumped manually. This was error-prone and versions frequently drifted. The bump script was updated in v2.4.7 to replace `apps/prism-setup` references with the Tauri installer.

### VERSION File

A single `VERSION` file at the repository root is the source of truth:

```
2.5.0
```

### Bump Script (`scripts/bump-version.py`)

```bash
python scripts/bump-version.py patch           # 2.5.0 -> 2.5.1
python scripts/bump-version.py minor           # 2.5.0 -> 2.6.0
python scripts/bump-version.py major           # 2.5.0 -> 3.0.0
python scripts/bump-version.py --set 2.6.0     # explicit version
```

The script reads the current version from `VERSION`, computes the new version, then updates all production version locations:

**JSON files** (update `"version"` field):

| # | File | What is Updated |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1 | `VERSION` | Root source of truth |
| 2 | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` JSON field |
| 3 | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version"` JSON field |
| 4 | `apps/prism-vscode/package.json` | `"version"` JSON field |
| 5 | `apps/prism-electron/package.json` | `"version"` JSON field |
| 6 | `apps/prism-installer/package.json` | `"version"` JSON field |
| 7 | `apps/prism-installer/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `"version"` JSON field |

**Text files** (find-and-replace of old → new):

| # | File | What is Updated |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 8 | `apps/prism-cli/main.go` | `var version = "X.Y.Z"` |
| 9 | `apps/prism-cli/app/footer.go` | `"vX.Y.Z"` hardcoded TUI footer |
| 10 | `packages/prism-core/src/shared/PrismState.ts` | `DEFAULT_PRISM_STATE.version` |
| 11 | `packages/prism-ui/src/context/PrismStateContext.tsx` | `DEFAULT_STATE.version` |

> **Deprecated**: `apps/prism-setup/` (Electron-based NSIS installer) entries are commented out in the script but kept for rollback.

### Where Version Appears to Users

| Platform | Location | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **CLI** | TUI footer (bottom-right powerline) | `footer.go:165` hardcoded string |
| **CLI** | `--version` flag | `main.go:19` via Cobra |
| **Electron** | Bottom status bar (24px, bottom-left) | `PrismState.ts` → `usePrismState().version` |
| **VS Code** | Panel status bar (22px, right side) | Controller state via `initialState` message |
| **VS Code** | Extensions panel | `package.json` `"version"` field |
| **Installer** | Title bar and version display | `tauri.conf.json` `"version"` field, read via `@tauri-apps/api/app` |

### Release Workflow Integration

The `/prism-release` skill uses the bump script:

```bash
# Step 1: Bump (one command updates all version files)
python scripts/bump-version.py patch --root .

# Step 2: Build
cd apps/prism-cli && make build-all

# Step 3: Commit + tag
git add -A && git commit -m "vX.Y.Z" && git tag vX.Y.Z
git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Step 4: GitHub release (triggers installer CI)
gh release create vX.Y.Z apps/prism-cli/bin/* ...
```


## Unified Tauri Installer (v2.4.7+)

Replaced the native NSIS-only Windows installer (`installer/`, v2.4.3) and the earlier Electron-based setup wizard (`apps/prism-setup/`) with a unified Tauri v2 cross-platform installer at `apps/prism-installer/`. The same Rust + React 19 codebase produces native Windows `.exe` (via NSIS bundler) and macOS `.dmg` installers with platform-specific wizard UIs.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Backend** | Rust + Tauri v2 | System access, IPC, window management |
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Tailwind v4 + Vite 6 | Wizard UI (platform-specific layouts) |
| **HTTP** | reqwest + rustls-tls | Streaming download (no OpenSSL dependency) |
| **Async** | tokio (full features) | Async download, file I/O |
| **Windows** | winreg, winapi | Registry access, PATH broadcast, disk space |
| **Bundler** | Tauri NSIS (Windows), DMG (macOS) | Native installer output |

### Tauri Commands (14 handlers)

```
detect_editors, detect_claude_cli, detect_claude_code, detect_all_tools,
detect_existing_prism, detect_os_info, detect_disk_space, run_preflight,
install_cli, install_all_extensions, install_plugin,
download_desktop_app, run_downloaded_installer,
uninstall, open_terminal
```

### Detection Engine (`detect.rs`)

The detection system uses a **three-tier strategy** per editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf):

| Tier | Strategy | Platform |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Registry scan** — HKLM/HKCU/WOW6432Node Uninstall keys | Windows |
| 2 | **Filesystem probe** — Known install paths (`Program Files`, `AppData\Local\Programs`, Squirrel `app-X.Y.Z`) | Windows |
| 3 | **PATH lookup** — `where.exe` (Windows) or `which` (macOS) | Both |
| — | **App bundle check** — `/Applications/` and `~/Applications/`, version from `package.json` or `Info.plist` | macOS |

**Data model**:
- `InstallMethod` enum: `SystemInstall`, `UserInstall`, `SquirrelInstall`, `NpmGlobal`, `Unknown`
- `DetectedTool`: name, version, path, install location, install method, CLI availability, metadata map
- `DetectionReport`: editors + claude_code + node_available + npm_prefix
- `PreflightResult`: full detection + OS info + disk info

**Claude Code detection**: Checks npm global prefix → `node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/package.json`, then PATH lookup via `which claude`, then Windows config-dir fallback at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code`.

### Wizard Flows

**Windows** (6 steps): Welcome → Components → Directory → Preflight → Progress → Finish

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Welcome | Branding, version, PRISM wordmark |
| Components | 4 checkboxes (CLI required + checked, VSCode + Plugin checked, Desktop unchecked ~130MB) |
| Directory | Install path, defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Prism` |
| Preflight | Sequential detection with animated reveal (OS, disk, editors, Claude Code, existing Prism) |
| Progress | Per-component progress bars with log panel (Consolas font, auto-scroll) |
| Finish | Installed summary, checkbox to open terminal, Close button |

**macOS** (6 steps): Introduction → License → Destination → Installation Type → Installing → Summary

- Two-panel layout: sidebar with step list (numbered circles, blue current, green completed) + content area
- macOS traffic light buttons (red/yellow/green circles with hover symbols)
- Per-component progress bars with colorized log (green ✓, amber →, red ✕)

### Install Components

| Component | Size | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Prism CLI** | ~2 MB | Required | Binary to `<install_dir>/bin/`, PATH config, `~/.prism/` init |
| **VS Code Extension** | ~8 MB | Checked | VSIX installed into ALL detected editors (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) |
| **Claude Code Plugin** | ~1 MB | Checked | `claude plugin install` or file copy fallback to `~/.claude/` |
| **Prism Desktop App** | ~130 MB | Unchecked | Streaming download from GitHub Releases, silent installer execution |

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/prism-installer-release.yml`)

```
prepare (ubuntu)       → build-windows (windows) + build-macos (macos)  → release
  Cross-compile CLI       Stage resources into src-tauri/resources/          Upload .exe + .dmg
  Package VSIX            npm run tauri build -- --bundles nsis|dmg          to GitHub Release
  Copy plugin files       (Rust + React frontend compilation)
```

**4 jobs**: `prepare` → `build-windows` + `build-macos` (parallel) → `release`

Triggers: `push tags v*` + `workflow_dispatch`

### Uninstall Support

The installer binary doubles as the uninstaller. On Windows:
- `prism-installer.exe --uninstall` triggers headless uninstall (no UI)
- Removes CLI binary, PATH entry, registry keys (`HKCU\Software\Prism`, Add/Remove Programs)
- Registered as `UninstallString` in Windows Add/Remove Programs

### Legacy Installers

| Installer | Location | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **NSIS scripts** | `installer/` | Legacy — `.nsi` scripts and built `.exe` files still on disk |
| **Electron setup** | `apps/prism-setup/` | Deprecated (v2.4.6) — not in npm workspaces, version no longer bumped |

# Part VII — Prism Eval Dashboard (Electron)

The Prism Eval Dashboard is a standalone Electron desktop application for running, viewing, and comparing skill evaluations across plugin versions. It works in tandem with the `prism-eval` skill and the `prism-release` pipeline to provide a visual quality assurance layer for prompt engineering.

## Eval Dashboard Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Location | `prism-eval/` |
| Runtime | Electron 40, React 19, TypeScript |
| Build | Electron Forge + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Layout | Dagre (DAG layout for agent traces) |
| Source files | 52 TypeScript/TSX files (~1,278 lines) |
| Window title | "Prism Admin — Eval Dashboard" |

### Purpose

When the `prism-eval` skill runs evaluations, it produces structured JSON output (`benchmark.json`, `grading.json`, `timing.json`) under `.prism/shared/evals/`. The Eval Dashboard reads these workspaces and presents the data across five interactive screens, enabling developers to:

- Monitor aggregate skill health across versions
- Drill into individual eval case pass/fail grades with evidence
- Replay agent execution traces as DAG visualizations
- Compare benchmark metrics (pass rate, tokens, time) between versions
- Visualize the skill dependency graph

The `EvalDataService` (main process) reads the workspace directory, parses all JSON files, and sends structured data to the renderer via IPC.

## Eval Dashboard Screens

### 1. Mission Control

The operational overview screen. Displays:

- **Stat cards**: Average pass rate, total evals run, skills improved, total tokens consumed
- **Skill Performance Table**: All skills with pass rate, eval count, delta, token usage
- **Version Progression**: Line chart showing pass rate trend across versions
- **Live Feed**: Chronological event log of eval runs (EVAL, TOOL, SPAWN, BENCH, COMPARE, GRADE events)
- **Delta Indicators**: Color-coded arrows showing improvement/regression per skill

### 2. Eval Explorer

Drill-down into individual eval cases:

- **Skill Filter Chips**: Filter by skill name
- **Eval Cards**: Each eval case showing prompt, with-skill score vs old-skill score, comparator verdict
- **Eval Detail Panel**: Slide-out panel with full prompt, expectations list (pass/fail with evidence), output preview
- **Expectations Panel**: Individual assertion rows with pass/fail badges and evidence quotes

### 3. Agent Traces

DAG-based visualization of agent execution:

- **DagCanvas**: Renders agent execution as a directed acyclic graph using Dagre layout
- **DagNode**: Individual agent steps (color-coded by status: complete/running/pending)
- **DagEdge**: Dependency arrows between steps
- **Playback Controls**: Step through trace execution chronologically
- **Step Detail Panel**: Selected step's tools used, duration, and output

### 4. Benchmarks

Version-to-version metric comparison:

- **Version Cards**: Side-by-side cards for current vs baseline versions
- **Metric Comparison**: Pass rate, mean tokens ± stddev, mean time ± stddev
- **Skill Breakdown**: Per-skill comparison table with delta highlighting
- **Outgrowth Warning**: Alerts when token usage grows disproportionately to quality gains

### 5. Skill Graph

Interactive visualization of skill relationships:

- **GraphCanvas**: Force-directed or hierarchical layout of skills, commands, and agents
- **GraphNode**: Nodes sized by line count, colored by model assignment
- **GraphLegend**: Model color key (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- **Node Detail Panel**: Click a node to see connections, line count, trigger patterns

## Eval Skill Integration

The Eval Dashboard is the visual frontend for the `prism-eval` skill workflow:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│ prism-release │────▶│  prism-eval  │────▶│  Eval Dashboard  │
│ (Step 7-8:   │     │  (Skill)     │     │  (Electron app)  │
│  snapshot +  │     │  Runs evals, │     │  Visualizes      │
│  eval gen)   │     │  grades,     │     │  benchmark.json, │
│              │     │  benchmarks) │     │  grading.json,   │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     │  timing.json)    │
                                          └──────────────────┘
```

### Eval Lifecycle

1. **`/prism-release`** creates a version snapshot (`.prism/shared/evals/v2.5.0-snapshot/`) and generates `evals.json` for each skill
2. **`prism-eval`** skill runs eval cases — spawns parallel agents, captures timing, grades outputs, builds `benchmark.json`
3. **Eval Dashboard** reads the workspace directory, presents results across all 5 screens
4. Developer reviews pass rates, identifies regressions, and iterates on skills

### Eval Data Schema

Eval cases are defined in `.prism/shared/evals/<version>/skills/<skill>/evals.json`:

```json
{
  "skill": "prism-research",
  "version": "v2.5.0",
  "baseline": "../../../v2.4.9-snapshot/skills/prism-research/SKILL.md",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "dimension": "output_quality|behavioral_compliance|regression",
      "prompt": "Research the authentication system in this codebase",
      "expected_output": "Structured research document with file:line references",
      "expectations": [
        "Output follows research template format",
        "Contains file:line references, not just file paths",
        "Does not suggest improvements (documentarian principle)"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
